As I’m sure you may know, it is important to hydrate regularly in order to preserve adequate mental and physical functions. Many of us do not pay attention to how much water we are drinking and how this can be affecting how we feel and what is happening inside of our bodies.\n\nMost of us ' do' drink water but... do you drink enough? Do you want to make sure you are doing your best to stay healthy? It is time to start tracking how much water you have drunk every day.\n\nWatermaniac is an app that will help you track the amount of water you drink.\n\nFeatures:\n- Set a daily goal of water\n- A history of all drink you took (and logged)\n- Customizable notifications to remind you about drinking\n\nIt is simple, lightweight and built with Google Flutter. Only core functionalities.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.12.13+hotfix.5\n"

If it does than there is not much that I can help you with. You can either stick with selinux disabled (not recommended by redhat) or switch to using ubuntu.\n\nYou may also set `DEBUG=true` to enable debugging of the entrypoint script, which could help you pin point any configuration issues.\n\nIf using the latest docker version and/or disabling selinux does not fix the issue then please file a issue request on the [issues](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab/issues) page.\n\nIn your issue report please make sure you provide the following information:\n\n- The host distribution and release version.\n- Output of the `docker version` command\n- Output of the `docker info` command\n- The `docker run` command you used to run the image (mask out the sensitive bits).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYour docker host needs to have 1GB or more of available RAM to run GitLab. Please refer to the GitLab [hardware requirements](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/install/requirements.md#hardware-requirements) documentation for additional information.\n\n## Installation\n\nAutomated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/gitlab) and is the recommended method of installation.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nYou can also pull the `latest` tag which is built from the repository *HEAD*\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/gitlab:latest\n```\n\nAlternatively you can build the image locally.\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t sameersbn/gitlab github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab/master/docker-compose.yml\n```\n\nGenerate random strings that are at least `64` characters long for each of `GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE`, `GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE`, and `GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE`. These values are used for the following:\n\n- `GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE` is used to encrypt 2FA secrets in the database. If you lose or rotate this secret, none of your users will be able to log in using 2FA.\n- `GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE` is used to encrypt CI secret variables, as well as import credentials, in the database. If you lose or rotate this secret, you will not be able to use existing CI secrets.\n- `GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE` is used for password reset links, and other 'standard' auth features. If you lose or rotate this secret, password reset tokens in emails will reset.\n\n> **Tip**: You can generate a random string using `pwgen -Bsv1 64` and assign it as the value of `GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE`.\n\nStart GitLab using:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can manually launch the `gitlab` container and the supporting `postgresql` and `redis` containers by following this three step guide.\n\nStep 1. Launch a postgresql container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab-postgresql -d \\\n    --env 'DB_NAME=gitlabhq_production' \\\n    --env 'DB_USER=gitlab' --env 'DB_PASS=password' \\\n    --env 'DB_EXTENSION=pg_trgm' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \\\n    sameersbn/postgresql:12-20200524\n```\n\nStep 2. Launch a redis container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab-redis -d \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/redis:/data \\\n    redis:6.2\n```\n\nStep 3. Launch the gitlab container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --link gitlab-postgresql:postgresql --link gitlab-redis:redisio \\\n    --publish 10022:22 --publish 10080:80 \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_PORT=10080' --env 'GITLAB_SSH_PORT=10022' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alpha-numeric-string' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alpha-numeric-string' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE=long-and-random-alpha-numeric-string' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n*Please refer to [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) to understand `GITLAB_PORT` and other configuration options*\n\n**NOTE**: Please allow a couple of minutes for the GitLab application to start.\n\nPoint your browser to `http://localhost:10080` and set a password for the `root` user account.\n\nYou should now have the GitLab application up and ready for testing. If you want to use this image in production then please read on.\n\n*The rest of the document will use the docker command line. You can quite simply adapt your configuration into a `docker-compose.yml` file if you wish to do so.*\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Data Store\n\nGitLab is a code hosting software and as such you don't want to lose your code when the docker container is stopped/deleted. To avoid losing any data, you should mount a volume at,\n\n- `/home/git/data`\n\n*Note: that if you are using the `docker-compose` approach, you must \"inpect\" the volumes (```docker volume inpect```) to check the mounted path.*\n\nSELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab\nsudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab\n```\n\nVolumes can be mounted in docker by specifying the `-v` option in the docker run command.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n### Database\n\nGitLab uses a database backend to store its data. You can configure this image to use PostgreSQL.\n\n*Note:* GitLab requieres PostgreSQL now. So use an older image < 12.1 or migrate to PostgresSQL\n\n#### PostgreSQL\n\n*NOTE:* version 13.7.0 and later requires PostgreSQL version 12.x\n\n##### External PostgreSQL Server\n\nThe image also supports using an external PostgreSQL Server. This is also controlled via environment variables.\n\n```sql\nCREATE ROLE gitlab with LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'password';\nCREATE DATABASE gitlabhq_production;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE gitlabhq_production to gitlab;\n```\n\nAdditionally since GitLab `8.6.0` the `pg_trgm` extension should also be loaded for the `gitlabhq_production` database.\n\nWe are now ready to start the GitLab application.\n\n*Note:* The following applies assuming that the PostgreSQL server host is `192.168.1.100`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --env 'DB_HOST=192.168.1.100' \\\n    --env 'DB_NAME=gitlabhq_production' \\\n    --env 'DB_USER=gitlab' --env 'DB_PASS=password' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n##### Linking to PostgreSQL Container\n\nYou can link this image with a postgresql container for the database requirements. The alias of the postgresql server container should be set to **postgresql** while linking with the gitlab image.\n\nIf a postgresql container is linked, only the `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` settings are automatically retrieved using the linkage. You may still need to set other database connection parameters such as the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and so on.\n\nTo illustrate linking with a postgresql container, we will use the [sameersbn/postgresql](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql) image. When using postgresql image in production you should mount a volume for the postgresql data store. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql/blob/master/README.md) of docker-postgresql for details.\n\nFirst, lets pull the postgresql image from the docker index.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/postgresql:12-20200524\n```\n\nFor data persistence lets create a store for the postgresql and start the container.\n\nSELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql\nsudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql\n```\n\nThe run command looks like this.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab-postgresql -d \\\n    --env 'DB_NAME=gitlabhq_production' \\\n    --env 'DB_USER=gitlab' --env 'DB_PASS=password' \\\n    --env 'DB_EXTENSION=pg_trgm' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \\\n    sameersbn/postgresql:12-20200524\n```\n\nThe above command will create a database named `gitlabhq_production` and also create a user named `gitlab` with the password `password` with access to the `gitlabhq_production` database.\n\nWe are now ready to start the GitLab application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d --link gitlab-postgresql:postgresql \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nHere the image will also automatically fetch the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` variables from the postgresql container as they are specified in the `docker run` command for the postgresql container. This is made possible using the magic of docker links and works with the following images:\n\n- [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)\n- [sameersbn/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/postgresql/)\n- [orchardup/postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/r/orchardup/postgresql/)\n- [paintedfox/postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/r/paintedfox/postgresql/)\n\n##### Upgrading PostgreSQL\n\nWhen this Gitlab image upgrades its dependency on specific version of PostgreSQL you will need to make sure to use corresponding version of PostgreSQL.\n\nIf you are setting a brand new install, there is no data migration involved. However, if you already have an existing setup, the PostgreSQL data will need to be migrated as you are upgrading the version of PostgreSQL.\n\nIf you are using PostgreSQL image other than [sameersbn/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/postgresql/) you will need make sure that the image you are using can handle migration itself, **or**, you will need to migrate the data yourself before starting newer version of PostgreSQL.\n\nFollowing project provides Docker image that handles migration of PostgreSQL data: [tianon/postgres-upgrade](https://hub.docker.com/r/tianon/postgres-upgrade/)\n\nAfter migration of the data, verify that other PostgreSQL configuration files in its data folder are copied over as well. One such file is `pg_hba.conf`, it will need to be copied from old version data folder into new version data folder.\n\n### Redis\n\nGitLab uses the redis server for its key-value data store. The redis server connection details can be specified using environment variables.\n\n#### Internal Redis Server\n\nThe internal redis server has been removed from the image. Please use a [linked redis](#linking-to-redis-container) container or specify a [external redis](#external-redis-server) connection.\n\n#### External Redis Server\n\nThe image can be configured to use an external redis server. The configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the GitLab image.\n\n*Note:* The following applies assuming that the redis server host is `192.168.1.100`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm \\\n    --env 'REDIS_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env 'REDIS_PORT=6379' \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n#### Linking to Redis Container\n\nYou can link this image with a redis container to satisfy gitlab's redis requirement. The alias of the redis server container should be set to **redisio** while linking with the gitlab image.\n\nTo illustrate linking with a redis container, we will use the [redis](https://github.com/docker-library/redis) image. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/redis/README.md) for details.\n\nFirst, lets pull the redis image from the docker index.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull redis:6.2\n```\n\nLets start the redis container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab-redis -d \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/redis:/data \\\n    redis:6.2\n```\n\nWe are now ready to start the GitLab application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d --link gitlab-redis:redisio \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n#### Mail\n\nThe mail configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the GitLab image. The configuration defaults to using gmail to send emails and requires the specification of a valid username and password to login to the gmail servers.\n\nIf you are using Gmail then all you need to do is:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --env 'SMTP_USER=USER@gmail.com' --env 'SMTP_PASS=PASSWORD' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nPlease refer the [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) section for the list of SMTP parameters that can be specified.\n\n##### Reply by email\n\nSince version `8.0.0` GitLab adds support for commenting on issues by replying to emails.\n\nTo enable this feature you need to provide IMAP configuration parameters that will allow GitLab to connect to your mail server and read mails. Additionally, you may need to specify `GITLAB_INCOMING_EMAIL_ADDRESS` if your incoming email address is not the same as the `IMAP_USER`.\n\nIf your email provider supports email [sub-addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Sub-addressing) then you should add the `+%{key}` placeholder after the user part of the email address, eg. `GITLAB_INCOMING_EMAIL_ADDRESS=reply+%{key}@example.com`. Please read the [documentation on reply by email](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/incoming_email/README.html) to understand the requirements for this feature.\n\nIf you are using Gmail then all you need to do is:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --env 'IMAP_USER=USER@gmail.com' --env 'IMAP_PASS=PASSWORD' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_INCOMING_EMAIL_ADDRESS=USER+%{key}@gmail.com' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nPlease refer the [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) section for the list of IMAP parameters that can be specified.\n\n#### SSL\n\nAccess to the gitlab application can be secured using SSL so as to prevent unauthorized access to the data in your repositories. While a CA certified SSL certificate allows for verification of trust via the CA, a self signed certificate can also provide an equal level of trust verification as long as each client takes some additional steps to verify the identity of your website. I will provide instructions on achieving this towards the end of this section.\n\nJump to the [Using HTTPS with a load balancer](#using-https-with-a-load-balancer) section if you are using a load balancer such as hipache, haproxy or nginx.\n\nTo secure your application via SSL you basically need two things:\n\n- **Private key (.key)**\n- **SSL certificate (.crt)**\n\nWhen using CA certified certificates, these files are provided to you by the CA. When using self-signed certificates you need to generate these files yourself. Skip to [Strengthening the server security](#strengthening-the-server-security) section if you are armed with CA certified SSL certificates.\n\n##### Generation of a Self Signed Certificate\n\nGeneration of a self-signed SSL certificate involves a simple 3-step procedure:\n\n**STEP 1**: Create the server private key\n\n```bash\nopenssl genrsa -out gitlab.key 2048\n```\n\n**STEP 2**: Create the certificate signing request (CSR)\n\n```bash\nopenssl req -new -key gitlab.key -out gitlab.csr\n```\n\n**STEP 3**: Sign the certificate using the private key and CSR\n\n```bash\nopenssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in gitlab.csr -signkey gitlab.key -out gitlab.crt\n```\n\nCongratulations! You now have a self-signed SSL certificate valid for 10 years.\n\n##### Strengthening the server security\n\nThis section provides you with instructions to [strengthen your server security](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html). To achieve this we need to generate stronger DHE parameters.\n\n```bash\nopenssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048\n```\n\n##### Installation of the SSL Certificates\n\nOut of the four files generated above, we need to install the `gitlab.key`, `gitlab.crt` and `dhparam.pem` files at the gitlab server. The CSR file is not needed, but do make sure you safely backup the file (in case you ever need it again).\n\nThe default path that the gitlab application is configured to look for the SSL certificates is at `/home/git/data/certs`, this can however be changed using the `SSL_KEY_PATH`, `SSL_CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `SSL_DHPARAM_PATH` configuration options.\n\nIf you remember from above, the `/home/git/data` path is the path of the [data store](#data-store), which means that we have to create a folder named `certs/` inside the volume to where `/home/git/data` point and copy the files into it and as a measure of security we'll update the permission on the `gitlab.key` file to only be readable by the owner.\n\nIn case use of docker-compose ...\n\n```$>docker volume inspect```\n\nlook for \"< user >_gitlab-data\" and copy the \"certs\" directory into the \"Mountpoint\"\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab/certs\ncp gitlab.key /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab/certs/\ncp gitlab.crt /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab/certs/\ncp dhparam.pem /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab/certs/\nchmod 400 /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab/certs/gitlab.key\n```\n\nGreat! we are now just one step away from having our application secured.\n\n##### Enabling HTTPS support\n\nHTTPS support can be enabled by setting the `GITLAB_HTTPS` option to `true`. Additionally, when using self-signed SSL certificates you need to the set `SSL_SELF_SIGNED` option to `true` as well. Assuming we are using self-signed certificates\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --publish 10022:22 --publish 10080:80 --publish 10443:443 \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_SSH_PORT=10022' --env 'GITLAB_PORT=10443' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_HTTPS=true' --env 'SSL_SELF_SIGNED=true' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nIn this configuration, any requests made over the plain http protocol will automatically be redirected to use the https protocol. However, this is not optimal when using a load balancer.\n\n##### Configuring HSTS\n\nHSTS if supported by the browsers makes sure that your users will only reach your sever via HTTPS. When the user comes for the first time it sees a header from the server which states for how long from now this site should only be reachable via HTTPS - that's the HSTS max-age value.\n\nWith `NGINX_HSTS_MAXAGE` you can configure that value. The default value is `31536000` seconds. If you want to disable a already sent HSTS MAXAGE value, set it to `0`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n --env 'GITLAB_HTTPS=true' --env 'SSL_SELF_SIGNED=true' \\\n --env 'NGINX_HSTS_MAXAGE=2592000' \\\n --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nIf you want to completely disable HSTS set `NGINX_HSTS_ENABLED` to `false`.\n\n##### Using HTTPS with a load balancer\n\nLoad balancers like nginx/haproxy/hipache talk to backend applications over plain http and as such the installation of ssl keys and certificates are not required and should **NOT** be installed in the container. The SSL configuration has to instead be done at the load balancer.\n\nHowever, when using a load balancer you **MUST** set `GITLAB_HTTPS` to `true`. Additionally you will need to set the `SSL_SELF_SIGNED` option to `true` if self signed SSL certificates are in use.\n\nWith this in place, you should configure the load balancer to support handling of https requests. But that is out of the scope of this document. Please refer to [Using SSL/HTTPS with HAProxy](http://seanmcgary.com/posts/using-sslhttps-with-haproxy) for information on the subject.\n\nWhen using a load balancer, you probably want to make sure the load balancer performs the automatic http to https redirection. Information on this can also be found in the link above.\n\nIn summation, when using a load balancer, the docker command would look for the most part something like this:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d \\\n    --publish 10022:22 --publish 10080:80 \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_SSH_PORT=10022' --env 'GITLAB_PORT=443' \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_HTTPS=true' --env 'SSL_SELF_SIGNED=true' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nAgain, drop the `--env 'SSL_SELF_SIGNED=true'` option if you are using CA certified SSL certificates.\n\nIn case GitLab responds to any kind of POST request (login, OAUTH, changing settings etc.) with a 422 HTTP Error, consider adding this to your reverse proxy configuration:\n\n`proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;` (nginx format)\n\n##### Establishing trust with your server\n\nThis section deals will self-signed ssl certificates. If you are using CA certified certificates, your done.\n\nThis section is more of a client side configuration so as to add a level of confidence at the client to be 100 percent sure they are communicating with whom they think they.\n\nThis is simply done by adding the servers certificate into their list of trusted certificates. On ubuntu, this is done by copying the `gitlab.crt` file to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and executing `update-ca-certificates`.\n\nAgain, this is a client side configuration which means that everyone who is going to communicate with the server should perform this configuration on their machine. In short, distribute the `gitlab.crt` file among your developers and ask them to add it to their list of trusted ssl certificates. Failure to do so will result in errors that look like this:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://git.local.host/gitlab-foss.git\nfatal: unable to access 'https://git.local.host/gitlab-foss.git': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none\n```\n\nYou can do the same at the web browser. Instructions for installing the root certificate for firefox can be found [here](http://portal.threatpulse.com/docs/sol/Content/03Solutions/ManagePolicy/SSL/ssl_firefox_cert_ta.htm). You will find similar options chrome, just make sure you install the certificate under the authorities tab of the certificate manager dialog.\n\nThere you have it, that's all there is to it.\n\n##### Installing Trusted SSL Server Certificates\n\nIf your GitLab CI server is using self-signed SSL certificates then you should make sure the GitLab CI server certificate is trusted on the GitLab server for them to be able to talk to each other.\n\nThe default path image is configured to look for the trusted SSL certificates is at `/home/git/data/certs/ca.crt`, this can however be changed using the `SSL_CA_CERTIFICATES_PATH` configuration option.\n\nCopy the `ca.crt` file into the certs directory on the [datastore](#data-store). The `ca.crt` file should contain the root certificates of all the servers you want to trust. With respect to GitLab CI, this will be the contents of the gitlab_ci.crt file as described in the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci/blob/master/README.md#ssl) of the [docker-gitlab-ci](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab-ci) container.\n\nBy default, our own server certificate [gitlab.crt](#generation-of-self-signed-certificate) is added to the trusted certificates list.\n\n#### Deploy to a subdirectory (relative url root)\n\nBy default GitLab expects that your application is running at the root (eg. /). This section explains how to run your application inside a directory.\n\nLet's assume we want to deploy our application to '/git'. GitLab needs to know this directory to generate the appropriate routes. This can be specified using the `GITLAB_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` configuration option like so:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm \\\n    --env 'GITLAB_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/git' \\\n    --volume /srv/docker/gitlab/gitlab:/home/git/data \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nGitLab will now be accessible at the `/git` path, e.g. `http://www.example.com/git`.\n\n**Note**: *The `GITLAB_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` parameter should always begin with a slash and* **SHOULD NOT** *have any trailing slashes.*\n\n#### OmniAuth Integration\n\nGitLab leverages OmniAuth to allow users to sign in using Twitter, GitHub, and other popular services. Configuring OmniAuth does not prevent standard GitLab authentication or LDAP (if configured) from continuing to work. Users can choose to sign in using any of the configured mechanisms.\n\nRefer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/omniauth.html) for additional information.\n\n##### CAS3\n\nTo enable the CAS OmniAuth provider you must register your application with your CAS instance. This requires the service URL GitLab will supply to CAS. It should be something like: `https://git.example.com:443/users/auth/cas3/callback?url`. By default handling for SLO is enabled, you only need to configure CAS for backchannel logout.\n\nFor example, if your cas server url is `https://sso.example.com`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_CAS3_SERVER=https://sso.example.com'` to the docker run command enables support for CAS3 OAuth. Please refer to [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) for additional CAS3 configuration parameters.\n\n##### Authentiq\n\nTo enable the Authentiq OmniAuth provider for passwordless authentication you must register an application with [Authentiq](https://www.authentiq.com/). Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/administration/auth/authentiq.html) for the procedure to generate the client ID and secret key with Authentiq.\n\nOnce you have the API client id and client secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your API key is `xxx` and the API secret key is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_CLIENT_ID=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_CLIENT_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for Authentiq OAuth.\n\nYou may want to specify `OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_REDIRECT_URI` as well. The OAuth scope can be altered as well with `OAUTH_AUTHENTIQ_SCOPE` (defaults to `'aq:name email~rs address aq:push'`).\n\n##### Google\n\nTo enable the Google OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with Google. Google will generate a client ID and secret key for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/google.html) for the procedure to generate the client ID and secret key with google.\n\nOnce you have the client ID and secret keys generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_GOOGLE_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your client ID is `xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com` and client secret key is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com' --env 'OAUTH_GOOGLE_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for Google OAuth.\n\nYou can also restrict logins to a single domain by adding `--env \"OAUTH_GOOGLE_RESTRICT_DOMAIN='example.com'\"`.\n\n##### Facebook\n\nTo enable the Facebook OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with Facebook. Facebook will generate a API key and secret for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/facebook.html) for the procedure to generate the API key and secret.\n\nOnce you have the API key and secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_FACEBOOK_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your API key is `xxx` and the API secret key is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_FACEBOOK_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for Facebook OAuth.\n\n##### Twitter\n\nTo enable the Twitter OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with Twitter. Twitter will generate a API key and secret for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/twitter.html) for the procedure to generate the API key and secret with twitter.\n\nOnce you have the API key and secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_TWITTER_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_TWITTER_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your API key is `xxx` and the API secret key is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_TWITTER_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_TWITTER_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for Twitter OAuth.\n\n##### GitHub\n\nTo enable the GitHub OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with GitHub. GitHub will generate a Client ID and secret for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/github.html) for the procedure to generate the Client ID and secret with github.\n\nOnce you have the Client ID and secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_GITHUB_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_GITHUB_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your Client ID is `xxx` and the Client secret is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_GITHUB_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_GITHUB_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for GitHub OAuth.\n\nUsers of GitHub Enterprise may want to specify `OAUTH_GITHUB_URL` and `OAUTH_GITHUB_VERIFY_SSL` as well.\n\n##### GitLab\n\nTo enable the GitLab OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with GitLab. GitLab will generate a Client ID and secret for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/gitlab.html) for the procedure to generate the Client ID and secret with GitLab.\n\nOnce you have the Client ID and secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_GITLAB_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_GITLAB_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your Client ID is `xxx` and the Client secret is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_GITLAB_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_GITLAB_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for GitLab OAuth.\n\n##### BitBucket\n\nTo enable the BitBucket OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with BitBucket. BitBucket will generate a Client ID and secret for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/bitbucket.html) for the procedure to generate the Client ID and secret with BitBucket.\n\nOnce you have the Client ID and secret generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_BITBUCKET_API_KEY` and `OAUTH_BITBUCKET_APP_SECRET` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your Client ID is `xxx` and the Client secret is `yyy`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_BITBUCKET_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_BITBUCKET_APP_SECRET=yyy'` to the docker run command enables support for BitBucket OAuth.\n\n##### SAML\n\nGitLab can be configured to act as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP). This allows GitLab to consume assertions from a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) such as Microsoft ADFS to authenticate users. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/saml.html).\n\nThe following parameters have to be configured to enable SAML OAuth support in this image: `OAUTH_SAML_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE_URL`, `OAUTH_SAML_IDP_CERT_FINGERPRINT`, `OAUTH_SAML_IDP_SSO_TARGET_URL`, `OAUTH_SAML_ISSUER` and `OAUTH_SAML_NAME_IDENTIFIER_FORMAT`.\n\nYou can also override the default \"Sign in with\" button label with `OAUTH_SAML_LABEL`.\n\nPlease refer to [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) for the default configurations of these parameters.\n\n##### Crowd\n\nTo enable the Crowd server OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with Crowd server.\n\nConfigure GitLab to enable access the Crowd server by specifying the `OAUTH_CROWD_SERVER_URL`, `OAUTH_CROWD_APP_NAME` and `OAUTH_CROWD_APP_PASSWORD` environment variables.\n\n##### Auth0\n\nTo enable the Auth0 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with [auth0](https://auth0.com/).\n\nConfigure the following environment variables `OAUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` and `OAUTH_AUTH0_DOMAIN` to complete the integration.\n\n##### Microsoft Azure\n\nTo enable the Microsoft Azure OAuth2 OmniAuth provider you must register your application with Azure. Azure will generate a Client ID, Client secret and Tenant ID for you to use. Please refer to the GitLab [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/azure.html) for the procedure.\n\nOnce you have the Client ID, Client secret and Tenant ID generated, configure them using the `OAUTH_AZURE_API_KEY`, `OAUTH_AZURE_API_SECRET` and `OAUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables respectively.\n\nFor example, if your Client ID is `xxx`, the Client secret is `yyy` and the Tenant ID is `zzz`, then adding `--env 'OAUTH_AZURE_API_KEY=xxx' --env 'OAUTH_AZURE_API_SECRET=yyy' --env 'OAUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID=zzz'` to the docker run command enables support for Microsoft Azure OAuth.\n\n##### Generic OAuth2\n\nTo enable the Generic OAuth2 provider, you must register your application with your provider. You also need to confirm OAuth2 provider app's ID and secret, the client options and the user's response structure.\n\nAs an example this code has been tested with Keycloak, with the following variables: `OAUTH2_GENERIC_APP_ID`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_APP_SECRET`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_CLIENT_SITE`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_CLIENT_USER_INFO_URL`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_CLIENT_AUTHORIZE_URL`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_CLIENT_TOKEN_URL`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_CLIENT_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_ID_PATH`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_USER_UID`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_USER_NAME`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_USER_EMAIL`, `OAUTH2_GENERIC_NAME`,\n\nSee [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth2_generic.html#sign-into-gitlab-with-almost-any-oauth2-provider) and [Omniauth-oauth2-generic documentation](https://gitlab.com/satorix/omniauth-oauth2-generic) for more details.\n\n#### Gitlab Pages\n\nGitlab Pages allows a user to host static websites from a project. Gitlab pages can be enabled with setting the envrionment variable `GITLAB_PAGES_ENABLED` to `true`.\n\n#### Gitlab Pages Access Control\n\nSince version `11.5.0` Gitlab pages supports access control. This allows only access to a published website if you are a project member, or have access to a certain project.\n\nGitlab pages access control requires additional configuration before activating it through the variable `GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_CONTROL`.\n\nGitab pages access control makes use of the Gitlab OAuth Module.\n\n- Goto the Gitlab Admin area\n- Select `Applications` in the menu\n- Create `New Application`\n    - Name: `Gitlab Pages`\n    - Scopes:\n        - api\n    - Trusted: NO (Do not select)\n    - Redirect URI: `https://projects.<GITLAB_PAGES_DOMAIN>/auth`\n\nNote about the `Redirect URI`; this can be tricky to configure or figure out, What needs to be achieved is to following, the redirect URI needs to end up at the `gitlab-pages` daemon with the `/auth` endpoint.\n\nThis means that if you run your gitlab pages at domain `pages.example.io` this will be a wilcard domain where your projects are created based on their namespace. The best trick is to enter a NON-Existing gitlab project pages URI as the redirect URI.\n\nIn the example above; the pages domain `projects` has been chosen. This will cause the nginx, either the built in or your own loadbalancer to redirect `*.<GITLAB_PAGES_DOMAIN>` to the `gitlab-pages` daemon. Which will trigger the pages endpoint.\n\nMake sure to choose own which does not exist and make sure that the request is routed to the `gitlab-pages` daemon if you are using your own HTTP load balancer in front of Gitlab.\n\nAfter creating the OAuth application endpoint for the Gitlab Pages Daemon. Gitlab pages access control can now be enabled.\n\nAdd to following environment variables to your Gitlab Container.\n\n| Variable | R/O | Description |\n|----------|-----|-------------|\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_CONTROL | Required | Set to `true` to enable access control. |\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_SECRET | Optional | Secret Hash, minimal 32 characters, if omitted, it will be auto generated. |\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_CONTROL_SERVER | Required | Gitlab instance URI, example: `https://gitlab.example.io` |\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID | Required | Client ID from earlier generated OAuth application |\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET | Required | Client Secret from earlier genereated OAuth application |\n| GITLAB_PAGES_ACCESS_REDIRECT_URI | Required | Redirect URI, non existing pages domain to redirect to pages daemon, `https://projects.example.io` |\n\nAfter you have enabled the gitlab pages access control. When you go to a project `General Settings` -> `Permissions` you can choose the pages persmission level for the project.\n\n#### External Issue Trackers\n\nSince version `7.10.0` support for external issue trackers can be enabled in the \"Service Templates\" section of the settings panel.\n\nIf you are using the [docker-redmine](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine) image, you can *one up* the gitlab integration with redmine by adding `--volumes-from=gitlab` flag to the docker run command while starting the redmine container.\n\nBy using the above option the `/home/git/data/repositories` directory will be accessible by the redmine container and now you can add your git repository path to your redmine project. If, for example, in your gitlab server you have a project named `opensource/gitlab`, the bare repository will be accessible at `/home/git/data/repositories/opensource/gitlab.git` in the redmine container.\n\n#### Host UID / GID Mapping\n\nPer default the container is configured to run gitlab as user and group `git` with `uid` and `gid` `1000`. The host possibly uses this ids for different purposes leading to unfavorable effects. From the host it appears as if the mounted data volumes are owned by the host's user/group `1000`.\n\nAlso the container processes seem to be executed as the host's user/group `1000`. The container can be configured to map the `uid` and `gid` of `git` to different ids on host by passing the environment variables `USERMAP_UID` and `USERMAP_GID`. The following command maps the ids to user and group `git` on the host.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [options] \\\n    --env \"USERMAP_UID=$(id -u git)\" --env \"USERMAP_GID=$(id -g git)\" \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\nWhen changing this mapping, all files and directories in the mounted data volume `/home/git/data` have to be re-owned by the new ids. This can be achieved automatically using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:sanitize\n```\n\n#### Piwik\n\nIf you want to monitor your gitlab instance with [Piwik](http://piwik.org/), there are two options to setup: `PIWIK_URL` and `PIWIK_SITE_ID`.\nThese options should contain something like:\n\n- `PIWIK_URL=piwik.example.org`\n- `PIWIK_SITE_ID=42`\n\n#### Available Configuration Parameters\n\n*Please refer the docker run command options for the `--env-file` flag where you can specify all required environment variables in a single file. This will save you from writing a potentially long docker run command. Alternatively you can use docker-compose. docker-compose users and Docker Swarm mode users can also use the [secrets and config file options](#docker-secrets-and-configs)*\n\nBelow is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your gitlab installation.\n\n##### `DEBUG`\n\nSet this to `true` to enable entrypoint debugging.\n\n##### `TZ`\n\nSet the container timezone. Defaults to `UTC`. Values are expected to be in Canonical format. Example: `Europe/Amsterdam`  See the list of [acceptable values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Ensure that your key is at least 32 characters long and that you don't lose it. You can generate one using `pwgen -Bsv1 64`. If you are migrating from GitLab CI, you need to set this value to the value of `GITLAB_CI_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE`. No defaults.\n\n##### `GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE`\n\nEncryption key for session secrets. Ensure that your key is at least 64 characters long and that you don't lose it. This secret can be rotated with minimal impact - the main effect is that previously-sent password reset emails will no longer work. You can generate one using `pwgen -Bsv1 64`. No defaults.\n\n##### `GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE`\n\n Encryption key for OTP related stuff with  GitLab. Ensure that your key is at least 64 characters long and that you don't lose it. **If you lose or change this secret, 2FA will stop working for all users.** You can generate one using `pwgen -Bsv1 64`. No defaults.\n\n##### `GITLAB_TIMEZONE`\n\nConfigure the timezone for the gitlab application. This configuration does not effect cron jobs. Defaults to `UTC`.

But do not alter the config\nkeys [`gitlab-configs`](contrib/docker-swarm/docker-compose.yml#L158) and\n[`gitlab-secrets`](contrib/docker-swarm/docker-compose.yml#L162) as they are currently\n[hardcoded](./assets/runtime/functions#L4:L9) and thus must be kept as in the example.\n\nIf you're not using one of these files, then don't include its entry in the docker-compose file.\n\n## Maintenance\n\n### Creating backups\n\nGitLab defines a rake task to take a backup of your gitlab installation. The backup consists of all git repositories, uploaded files and as you might expect, the sql database.\n\nBefore taking a backup make sure the container is stopped and removed to avoid container name conflicts.\n\n```bash\ndocker stop gitlab && docker rm gitlab\n```\n\nExecute the rake task to create a backup.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:backup:create\n```\n\nA backup will be created in the backups folder of the [Data Store](#data-store). You can change the location of the backups using the `GITLAB_BACKUP_DIR` configuration parameter.\n\n*P.S. Backups can also be generated on a running instance using `docker exec` as described in the [Rake Tasks](#rake-tasks) section. However, to avoid undesired side-effects, I advice against running backup and restore operations on a running instance.*\n\nWhen using `docker-compose` you may use the following command to execute the backup.\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose rm -sf gitlab\ndocker-compose run --rm gitlab app:rake gitlab:backup:create\n```\n\nAfterwards you can bring your Instance back with the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n### Restoring Backups\n\nGitLab also defines a rake task to restore a backup.\n\nBefore performing a restore make sure the container is stopped and removed to avoid container name conflicts.\n\n```bash\ndocker stop gitlab && docker rm gitlab\n```\n\nIf this is a fresh database that you're doing the restore on, first\nyou need to prepare the database:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake db:setup\n```\n\nExecute the rake task to restore a backup. Make sure you run the container in interactive mode `-it`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:backup:restore\n```\n\nThe list of all available backups will be displayed in reverse chronological order. Select the backup you want to restore and continue.\n\nTo avoid user interaction in the restore operation, specify the timestamp, date and version of the backup using the `BACKUP` argument to the rake task.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=1515629493_2020_12_06_13.0.6\n```\n\nWhen using `docker-compose` you may use the following command to execute the restore.\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose run --rm gitlab app:rake gitlab:backup:restore # List available backups\ndocker-compose run --rm gitlab app:rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=1515629493_2020_12_06_13.10.0 # Choose to restore from 1515629493\n```\n\n### Host Key Backups (ssh)\n\nSSH keys are not backed up in the normal gitlab backup process. You\nwill need to backup the `ssh/` directory in the data volume by hand\nand you will want to restore it prior to doing a gitlab restore.\n\n### Automated Backups\n\nThe image can be configured to automatically take backups `daily`, `weekly` or `monthly` using the `GITLAB_BACKUP_SCHEDULE` configuration option.\n\nDaily backups are created at `GITLAB_BACKUP_TIME` which defaults to `04:00` everyday. Weekly backups are created every Sunday at the same time as the daily backups. Monthly backups are created on the 1st of every month at the same time as the daily backups.\n\nBy default, when automated backups are enabled, backups are held for a period of 7 days. While when automated backups are disabled, the backups are held for an infinite period of time. This behavior can be configured via the `GITLAB_BACKUP_EXPIRY` option.\n\n#### Amazon Web Services (AWS) Remote Backups\n\nThe image can be configured to automatically upload the backups to an AWS S3 bucket. To enable automatic AWS backups first add `--env 'AWS_BACKUPS=true'` to the docker run command. In addition `AWS_BACKUP_REGION` and `AWS_BACKUP_BUCKET` must be properly configured to point to the desired AWS location. Finally an IAM user must be configured with appropriate access permission and their AWS keys exposed through `AWS_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.\n\nMore details about the appropriate IAM user properties can found on [doc.gitlab.com](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#upload-backups-to-remote-cloud-storage)\n\nFor remote backup to selfhosted s3 compatible storage, use `AWS_BACKUP_ENDPOINT`.\n\nAWS uploads are performed alongside normal backups, both through the appropriate `app:rake` command and when an automatic backup is performed.\n\n#### Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Remote Backups\n\nThe image can be configured to automatically upload the backups to an Google Cloud Storage bucket. To enable automatic GCS backups first add `--env 'GCS_BACKUPS=true'` to the docker run command. In addition `GCS_BACKUP_BUCKET` must be properly configured to point to the desired GCS location.\nFinally a couple of `Interoperable storage access keys` user must be created and their keys exposed through `GCS_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `GCS_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.\n\nMore details about the Cloud storage interoperability  properties can found on [cloud.google.com/storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability)\n\nGCS uploads are performed alongside normal backups, both through the appropriate `app:rake` command and when an automatic backup is performed.\n\n### Rake Tasks\n\nThe `app:rake` command allows you to run gitlab rake tasks. To run a rake task simply specify the task to be executed to the `app:rake` command. For example, if you want to gather information about GitLab and the system it runs on.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:env:info\n```\n\nYou can also use `docker exec` to run raketasks on running gitlab instance. For example,\n\n```bash\ndocker exec --user git -it gitlab bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nSimilarly, to import bare repositories into GitLab project instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:import:repos\n```\n\nOr\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it gitlab sudo -HEu git bundle exec rake gitlab:import:repos RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nFor a complete list of available rake tasks please refer <https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/tree/master/doc/raketasks> or the help section of your gitlab installation.\n\n*P.S. Please avoid running the rake tasks for backup and restore operations on a running gitlab instance.*\n\nTo use the `app:rake` command with `docker-compose` use the following command.\n\n```bash\n## For stopped instances\ndocker-compose run --rm gitlab app:rake gitlab:env:info\ndocker-compose run --rm gitlab app:rake gitlab:import:repos\n\n## For running instances\ndocker-compose exec --user git gitlab bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production\ndocker-compose exec gitlab sudo -HEu git bundle exec rake gitlab:import:repos RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\n### Import Repositories\n\nCopy all the **bare** git repositories to the `repositories/` directory of the [data store](#data-store) and execute the `gitlab:import:repos` rake task like so:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0 app:rake gitlab:import:repos\n```\n\nWatch the logs and your repositories should be available into your new gitlab container.\n\nSee [Rake Tasks](#rake-tasks) for more information on executing rake tasks.\nUsage when using `docker-compose` can also be found there.\n\n### Upgrading\n\n> **Important Notice**\n>\n> Since GitLab release `8.6.0` PostgreSQL users should enable `pg_trgm` extension on the GitLab database. Refer to GitLab's [Postgresql Requirements](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/requirements.html#postgresql-requirements) for more information\n>\n> If you're using `sameersbn/postgresql` then please upgrade to `sameersbn/postgresql:12-20200524` or later and add `DB_EXTENSION=pg_trgm,btree_gist` to the environment of the PostgreSQL container (see: <https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L8>).\n>\n> As of version 13.7.0, the required PostgreSQL is version 12.x. If you're using PostgreSQL image other than the above, please review section [Upgrading PostgreSQL](#upgrading-postgresql).\n\nGitLabHQ releases new versions on the 22nd of every month, bugfix releases immediately follow. I update this project almost immediately when a release is made (at least it has been the case so far). If you are using the image in production environments I recommend that you delay updates by a couple of days after the gitlab release, allowing some time for the dust to settle down.\n\nTo upgrade to newer gitlab releases, simply follow this 4 step upgrade procedure.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> Upgrading to `sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0` from `sameersbn/gitlab:7.x.x` can cause issues. It is therefore required that you first upgrade to `sameersbn/gitlab:8.0.5-1` before upgrading to `sameersbn/gitlab:8.1.0` or higher.\n\n- **Step 1**: Update the docker image.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n- **Step 2**: Stop and remove the currently running image\n\n```bash\ndocker stop gitlab\ndocker rm gitlab\n```\n\n- **Step 3**: Create a backup\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/gitlab:x.x.x app:rake gitlab:backup:create\n```\n\nReplace `x.x.x` with the version you are upgrading from. For example, if you are upgrading from version `6.0.0`, set `x.x.x` to `6.0.0`\n\n- **Step 4**: Start the image\n\n> **Note**: Since GitLab `8.0.0` you need to provide the `GITLAB_SECRETS_DB_KEY_BASE` parameter while starting the image.\n> **Note**: Since GitLab `8.11.0` you need to provide the `GITLAB_SECRETS_SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `GITLAB_SECRETS_OTP_KEY_BASE` parameters while starting the image. These should initially both have the same value as the contents of the `/home/git/data/.secret` file. See [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) for more information on these parameters.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name gitlab -d [OPTIONS] sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n```\n\n### Shell Access\n\nFor debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell using `docker exec` command.\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it gitlab bash\n```\n\n## Monitoring\n\nYou can monitor your GitLab instance status as described in the [official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/monitoring/health_check.html), for example:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'https://gitlab.example.com/-/liveness'\n```\n\nOn success, the endpoint will return a `200` HTTP status code, and a response like below.\n\n```bash\n{\n   \"status\": \"ok\"\n}\n```\n\nTo do that you will need to set the environment variable `GITLAB_MONITORING_IP_WHITELIST` to allow your IP or subnet to make requests to your GitLab instance.\n\n### Health Check\n\nYou can also set your `docker-compose.yml` [healthcheck](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#healthcheck) configuration to make periodic checks:\n\n```yml\nversion: '2.3'\n\nservices:\n  gitlab:\n    image: sameersbn/gitlab:14.10.0\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [\"CMD\", \"/usr/local/sbin/healthcheck\"]\n      interval: 1m\n      timeout: 5s\n      retries: 5\n      start_period: 2m\n```\n\nThen you will be able to consult the healthcheck log by executing:\n\n```bash\ndocker inspect --format \"{{json .State.Health }}\" $(docker-compose ps -q gitlab) | jq\n```\n\n## References\n\n- <https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq>\n- <https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md>\n- <http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule>\n- <https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html>\n- <https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-recipes/blob/master/web-server/nginx/gitlab-ssl>\n- <https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter>\n- <https://jpetazzo.github.io/2014/03/23/lxc-attach-nsinit-nsenter-docker-0-9/>\n"

The main reason is time. The second one is probably the complexity of notifications on both iOS and Android.\nSince this project probably need a huge refactor to fix some issue or to implement new features. I think you should probably consider these alternatives: [Notifee](https://notifee.app) free since september or [react-native-notifications](https://github.com/wix/react-native-notifications).\n\nIf you are interested in being a maintainer of this project, feel free to ask in issues.\n\n## \uD83C\uDF89 Version 7.x is live ! \uD83C\uDF89\n\nCheck out for changes and migration in the CHANGELOG:\n\n[Changelog](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n# Supporting the project\n\nMaintainers are welcome ! Feel free to contact me :wink:\n\n## Changelog\n\nChangelog is available from version 3.1.3 here: [Changelog](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Installation\n\n### NPM\n\n```\nnpm install --save react-native-push-notification\n```\n\n### Yarn\n\n```\nyarn add react-native-push-notification\n```\n\n**NOTE: If you target iOS you also need to follow the [installation instructions for PushNotificationIOS](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-push-notification-ios) since this package depends on it.**\n\n**NOTE: For Android, you will still have to manually update the AndroidManifest.xml (as below) in order to use Scheduled Notifications.**\n\n## Issues\n\nHaving a problem? Read the [troubleshooting](./trouble-shooting.md) guide before raising an issue.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n[Please read...](./submitting-a-pull-request.md)\n\n## iOS manual Installation\n\nThe component uses PushNotificationIOS for the iOS part. You should follow their [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-push-notification-ios).\n\n## Android manual Installation\n\n**NOTE: `firebase-messaging`, prior to version 15 requires to have the same version number in order to work correctly at build time and at run time. To use a specific version:**\n\nIn your `android/build.gradle`\n\n```gradle\next {\n    googlePlayServicesVersion = \"<Your play services version>\" // default: \"+\"\n    firebaseMessagingVersion = \"<Your Firebase version>\" // default: \"21.1.0\"\n\n    // Other settings\n    compileSdkVersion = <Your compile SDK version> // default: 23\n    buildToolsVersion = \"<Your build tools version>\" // default: \"23.0.1\"\n    targetSdkVersion = <Your target SDK version> // default: 23\n    supportLibVersion = \"<Your support lib version>\" // default: 23.1.1\n}\n```\n\n**NOTE: localNotification() works without changes in the application part, while localNotificationSchedule() only works with these changes:**\n\nIn your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`\n\n```xml\n    .....\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.VIBRATE\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\"/>\n\n    <application ....>\n        <!-- Change the value to true to enable pop-up for in foreground on receiving remote notifications (for prevent duplicating while showing local notifications set this to false) -->\n        <meta-data  android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.notification_foreground\"\n                    android:value=\"false\"/>\n        <!-- Change the resource name to your App's accent color - or any other color you want -->\n        <meta-data  android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.notification_color\"\n                    android:resource=\"@color/white\"/> <!-- or @android:color/{name} to use a standard color -->\n\n        <receiver android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationActions\" />\n        <receiver android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationPublisher\" />\n        <receiver android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationBootEventReceiver\">\n            <intent-filter>\n                <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED\" />\n                <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON\" />\n                <action android:name=\"com.htc.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON\"/>\n            </intent-filter>\n        </receiver>\n\n        <service\n            android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationListenerService\"\n            android:exported=\"false\" >\n            <intent-filter>\n                <action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\" />\n            </intent-filter>\n        </service>\n     .....\n```\n\nIf not using a built in Android color (`@android:color/{name}`) for the `notification_color` `meta-data` item.\nIn `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` (Create the file if it doesn't exist).\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n    <color name=\"white\">#FFF</color>\n</resources>\n```\n\nIf your app has an @Override on onNewIntent in `MainActivity.java` ensure that function includes a super call on onNewIntent (if your `MainActivity.java` does not have an @Override for onNewIntent skip this):\n\n```java\n    @Override\n    public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n        ...\n        super.onNewIntent(intent);\n        ...\n    }\n```\n\n### If you use remote notifications\n\nMake sure you have installed setup Firebase correctly.\n\nIn `android/build.gradle`\n\n```gradle\n\nbuildscript {\n    ...\n    dependencies {\n        ...\n        classpath('com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3')\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn `android/app/build.gradle`\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:17.3.0'\n  ...\n}\n\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n\n```\n\nThen put your `google-services.json` in `android/app/`.\n\n**Note: [firebase/release-notes](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android)**\n\n> The Firebase Android library `firebase-core` is no longer needed. This SDK included the Firebase SDK for Google Analytics.\n>\n> Now, to use Analytics or any Firebase product that recommends the use of Analytics (see table below), you need to explicitly add the Analytics dependency: `com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:17.3.0`.\n\n### If you don't use autolink\n\nIn `android/settings.gradle`\n\n```gradle\n...\ninclude ':react-native-push-notification'\nproject(':react-native-push-notification').projectDir = file('../node_modules/react-native-push-notification/android')\n```\n\nIn your `android/app/build.gradle`\n\n```gradle\n dependencies {\n    ...\n    implementation project(':react-native-push-notification')\n    ...\n }\n```\n\nManually register module in `MainApplication.java` (if you did not use `react-native link`):\n\n```java\nimport com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.ReactNativePushNotificationPackage;  // <--- Import Package\n\npublic class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n\n  private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {\n      @Override\n      protected boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {\n        return BuildConfig.DEBUG;\n      }\n\n      @Override\n      protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n\n          return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n              new MainReactPackage(),\n              new ReactNativePushNotificationPackage() // <---- Add the Package\n          );\n    }\n  };\n\n  ....\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**DO NOT USE `.configure()` INSIDE A COMPONENT, EVEN `App`**\n> If you do, notification handlers will not fire, because they are not loaded. Instead, use `.configure()` in the app's first file, usually `index.js`.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport PushNotificationIOS from \"@react-native-community/push-notification-ios\";\nimport PushNotification from \"react-native-push-notification\";\n\n// Must be outside of any component LifeCycle (such as `componentDidMount`).\nPushNotification.configure({\n  // (optional) Called when Token is generated (iOS and Android)\n  onRegister: function (token) {\n    console.log(\"TOKEN:\", token);\n  },\n\n  // (required) Called when a remote is received or opened, or local notification is opened\n  onNotification: function (notification) {\n    console.log(\"NOTIFICATION:\", notification);\n\n    // process the notification\n\n    // (required) Called when a remote is received or opened, or local notification is opened\n    notification.finish(PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult.NoData);\n  },\n\n  // (optional) Called when Registered Action is pressed and invokeApp is false, if true onNotification will be called (Android)\n  onAction: function (notification) {\n    console.log(\"ACTION:\", notification.action);\n    console.log(\"NOTIFICATION:\", notification);\n\n    // process the action\n  },\n\n  // (optional) Called when the user fails to register for remote notifications. Typically occurs when APNS is having issues, or the device is a simulator. (iOS)\n  onRegistrationError: function(err) {\n    console.error(err.message, err);\n  },\n\n  // IOS ONLY (optional): default: all - Permissions to register.\n  permissions: {\n    alert: true,\n    badge: true,\n    sound: true,\n  },\n\n  // Should the initial notification be popped automatically\n  // default: true\n  popInitialNotification: true,\n\n  /**\n   * (optional) default: true\n   * - Specified if permissions (ios) and token (android and ios) will requested or not,\n   * - if not, you must call PushNotificationsHandler.requestPermissions() later\n   * - if you are not using remote notification or do not have Firebase installed, use this:\n   *     requestPermissions: Platform.OS === 'ios'\n   */\n  requestPermissions: true,\n});\n```\n\n## Example app\n\nExample folder contains an example app to demonstrate how to use this package. The notification Handling is done in `NotifService.js`.\n\nPlease test your PRs with this example app before submitting them. It'll help maintaining this repo.\n\n## Handling Notifications\n\nWhen any notification is opened or received the callback `onNotification` is called passing an object with the notification data.\n\nNotification object example:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    foreground: false, // BOOLEAN: If the notification was received in foreground or not\n    userInteraction: false, // BOOLEAN: If the notification was opened by the user from the notification area or not\n    message: 'My Notification Message', // STRING: The notification message\n    data: {}, // OBJECT: The push data or the defined userInfo in local notifications\n}\n```\n\n## Local Notifications\n\n```js\nPushNotification.localNotification(details: Object)\n```\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.localNotification({\n  /* Android Only Properties */\n  channelId: \"your-channel-id\", // (required) channelId, if the channel doesn't exist, notification will not trigger.\n  ticker: \"My Notification Ticker\", // (optional)\n  showWhen: true, // (optional) default: true\n  autoCancel: true, // (optional) default: true\n  largeIcon: \"ic_launcher\", // (optional) default: \"ic_launcher\".

For apps targeting Build.VERSION_CODES.N and above, this time is not shown anymore by default and must be opted into by using `showWhen`, default: null.\n  usesChronometer: false, // (optional) Show the `when` field as a stopwatch. Instead of presenting `when` as a timestamp, the notification will show an automatically updating display of the minutes and seconds since when. Useful when showing an elapsed time (like an ongoing phone call), default: false.\n  timeoutAfter: null, // (optional) Specifies a duration in milliseconds after which this notification should be canceled, if it is not already canceled, default: null\n\n  messageId: \"google:message_id\", // (optional) added as `message_id` to intent extras so opening push notification can find data stored by @react-native-firebase/messaging module. \n\n  actions: [\"Yes\", \"No\"], // (Android only) See the doc for notification actions to know more\n  invokeApp: true, // (optional) This enable click on actions to bring back the application to foreground or stay in background, default: true\n\n  /* iOS only properties */\n  category: \"\", // (optional) default: empty string\n  subtitle: \"My Notification Subtitle\", // (optional) smaller title below notification title\n\n  /* iOS and Android properties */\n  id: 0, // (optional) Valid unique 32 bit integer specified as string. default: Autogenerated Unique ID\n  title: \"My Notification Title\", // (optional)\n  message: \"My Notification Message\", // (required)\n  picture: \"https://www.example.tld/picture.jpg\", // (optional) Display an picture with the notification, alias of `bigPictureUrl` for Android. default: undefined\n  userInfo: {}, // (optional) default: {} (using null throws a JSON value '<null>' error)\n  playSound: false, // (optional) default: true\n  soundName: \"default\", // (optional) Sound to play when the notification is shown. Value of 'default' plays the default sound. It can be set to a custom sound such as 'android.resource://com.xyz/raw/my_sound'. It will look for the 'my_sound' audio file in 'res/raw' directory and play it. default: 'default' (default sound is played)\n  number: 10, // (optional) Valid 32 bit integer specified as string. default: none (Cannot be zero)\n  repeatType: \"day\", // (optional) Repeating interval. Check 'Repeating Notifications' section for more info.\n});\n```\n\n## Scheduled Notifications\n\n```js\nPushNotification.localNotificationSchedule(details: Object)\n```\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({\n  //... You can use all the options from localNotifications\n  message: \"My Notification Message\", // (required)\n  date: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 1000), // in 60 secs\n  allowWhileIdle: false, // (optional) set notification to work while on doze, default: false\n\n  /* Android Only Properties */\n  repeatTime: 1, // (optional) Increment of configured repeatType. Check 'Repeating Notifications' section for more info.\n});\n```\n\n## Get the initial notification\n\n```js\nPushNotification.popInitialNotification(callback)\n```\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.popInitialNotification((notification) => {\n  console.log('Initial Notification', notification);\n});\n```\n\n## Custom sounds\n\nIn android, add your custom sound file to `[project_root]/android/app/src/main/res/raw`\n\nIn iOS, add your custom sound file to the project `Resources` in xCode.\n\nIn the location notification json specify the full file name:\n\n    soundName: 'my_sound.mp3'\n\n## Channel Management (Android)\n\nTo use channels, create them at startup and pass the matching `channelId` through to `PushNotification.localNotification` or `PushNotification.localNotificationSchedule`.\n\n```javascript\nimport PushNotification, {Importance} from 'react-native-push-notification';\n...\n  PushNotification.createChannel(\n    {\n      channelId: \"channel-id\", // (required)\n      channelName: \"My channel\", // (required)\n      channelDescription: \"A channel to categorise your notifications\", // (optional) default: undefined.\n      playSound: false, // (optional) default: true\n      soundName: \"default\", // (optional) See `soundName` parameter of `localNotification` function\n      importance: Importance.HIGH, // (optional) default: Importance.HIGH. Int value of the Android notification importance\n      vibrate: true, // (optional) default: true. Creates the default vibration pattern if true.\n    },\n    (created) => console.log(`createChannel returned '${created}'`) // (optional) callback returns whether the channel was created, false means it already existed.\n  );\n```\n\n**NOTE: Without channel, notifications don't work**\n\nIn the notifications options, you must provide a channel id with `channelId: \"your-channel-id\"`, if the channel doesn't exist the notification might not be triggered. Once the channel is created, the channel cannot be updated. Make sure your `channelId` is different if you change these options. If you have created a channel in another way, it will apply options of the channel.\n\nIf you want to use a different default channel for remote notification, refer to the documentation of Firebase:\n\n[Set up a Firebase Cloud Messaging client app on Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client?hl=fr)\n\n```xml\n  <meta-data\n      android:name=\"com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id\"\n      android:value=\"@string/default_notification_channel_id\" />\n```\n\nFor local notifications, the same kind of option is available:\n\n- you can use:\n  ```xml\n    <meta-data\n        android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.default_notification_channel_id\"\n        android:value=\"@string/default_notification_channel_id\" />\n  ```\n- If not defined, fallback to the Firebase value defined in the `AndroidManifest`:\n  ```xml\n    <meta-data\n        android:name=\"com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id\"\n        android:value=\"...\" />\n  ```\n- If not defined, fallback to the default Firebase channel id `fcm_fallback_notification_channel`\n\n### List channels\n\nYou can list available channels with:\n\n```js\nPushNotification.getChannels(function (channel_ids) {\n  console.log(channel_ids); // ['channel_id_1']\n});\n```\n\n### Channel exists\n\nYou can check if a channel exists with:\n\n```js\nPushNotification.channelExists(channel_id, function (exists) {\n  console.log(exists); // true/false\n});\n```\n\n### Channel blocked\n\nYou can check if a channel blocked with:\n\n```js\nPushNotification.channelBlocked(channel_id, function (blocked) {\n  console.log(blocked); // true/false\n});\n```\n\n### Delete channel\n\nYou can delete a channel with:\n\n```js\nPushNotification.deleteChannel(channel_id);\n```\n\n## Cancelling notifications\n\n### 1) cancelLocalNotification\n\nThe `id` parameter for `PushNotification.localNotification` is required for this operation. The id supplied will then be used for the cancel operation.\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.localNotification({\n    ...\n    id: '123'\n    ...\n});\nPushNotification.cancelLocalNotification('123');\n```\n\n### 2) cancelAllLocalNotifications\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.cancelAllLocalNotifications()\n```\n\nCancels all scheduled notifications AND clears the notifications alerts that are in the notification centre.\n\n### 3) removeAllDeliveredNotifications\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.removeAllDeliveredNotifications();\n```\n\nRemove all delivered notifications from Notification Center\n\n### 4) getDeliveredNotifications\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.getDeliveredNotifications(callback);\n```\n\nProvides you with a list of the app’s notifications that are still displayed in Notification Center\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name     | Type     | Required | Description                                                 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| callback | function | Yes      | Function which receive an array of delivered notifications. |\n\nA delivered notification is an object containing:\n\n- `identifier` : The identifier of this notification.\n- `title` : The title of this notification.\n- `body` : The body of this notification.\n- `category` : The category of this notification (optional).\n- `userInfo` : An object containing additional notification data (optional).\n- `thread-id` : The thread identifier of this notification, if has one.\n\n### 5) removeDeliveredNotifications\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.removeDeliveredNotifications(identifiers);\n```\n\nRemoves the specified notifications from Notification Center\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name        | Type  | Required | Description                        |\n| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| identifiers | array | Yes      | Array of notification identifiers. |\n\n### 6) getScheduledLocalNotifications\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.getScheduledLocalNotifications(callback);\n```\n\nProvides you with a list of the app’s scheduled local notifications that are yet to be displayed\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n| Name     | Type     | Required | Description                                                 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| callback | function | Yes      | Function which receive an array of delivered notifications. |\n\nReturns an array of local scheduled notification objects containing:\n\n| Name           | Type   | Description                                              |\n| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| id             | number | The identifier of this notification.                     |\n| date           | Date   | The fire date of this notification.                      |\n| title          | string | The title of this notification.                          |\n| message        | string | The message body of this notification.                   |\n| soundName      | string | The sound name of this notification.                     |\n| repeatInterval | number | (Android only) The repeat interval of this notification. |\n| number         | number | App notification badge count number.                     |\n| data           | any    | The user info of this notification.                      |\n\n## Abandon Permissions\n\n```js\nPushNotification.abandonPermissions()\n```\nRevokes the current token and unregister for all remote notifications received via APNS or FCM.\n\n## Notification priority\n\n(optional) Specify `priority` to set priority of notification. Default value: \"high\"\n\nAvailable options:\n\n```\n\"max\" = NotficationCompat.PRIORITY_MAX\\\n\"high\" = NotficationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH\\\n\"low\" = NotficationCompat.PRIORITY_LOW\\\n\"min\" = NotficationCompat.PRIORITY_MIN\\\n\"default\" = NotficationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT\n```\n\nMore information: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#PRIORITY_DEFAULT\n\n## Notification visibility\n\n(optional) Specify `visibility` to set visibility of notification. Default value: \"private\"\n\nAvailable options:\n\n```\n\"private\" = NotficationCompat.VISIBILITY_PRIVATE\\\n\"public\" = NotficationCompat.VISIBILITY_PUBLIC\\\n\"secret\" = NotficationCompat.VISIBILITY_SECRET \n```\nMore information: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#VISIBILITY_PRIVATE\n\n## Notification importance\n\n(optional) Specify `importance` to set importance of notification. Default value: Importance.HIGH  \nConstants available on the `Importance` object. `import PushNotification, {Importance} from 'react-native-push-notification';`\n\nAvailable options:\n```\nImportance.DEFAULT = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT\\\nImportance.HIGH = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH\\\nImportance.LOW = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_LOW\\\nImportance.MIN = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_MIN\\\nImportance.NONE= NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_NONE\\\nImportance.UNSPECIFIED = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_UNSPECIFIED\n```\n\nMore information: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager#IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT\n\n## Show notifications while the app is in foreground\n\nIf you want a consistent results in Android & iOS with the most flexibility, it is best to handle it manually by prompting a local notification when `onNotification` is triggered by a remote push notification on foreground (check `notification.foreground` prop).\n\nWatch out for an infinite loop triggering `onNotification` - remote & local notification will trigger it. You can overcome this by marking local notifications' data.\n\n## Notification while idle\n\n(optional) Specify `allowWhileIdle` to set if the notification should be allowed to execute even when the system is on low-power idle modes.\n\nOn Android 6.0 (API level 23) and forward, the Doze was introduced to reduce battery consumption when the device is unused for long periods of time. But while on Doze the AlarmManager alarms (used to show scheduled notifications) are deferred to the next maintenance window. This may cause the notification to be delayed while on Doze.\n\nThis can significantly impact the power use of the device when idle. So it must only be used when the notification is required to go off on a exact time, for example on a calendar notification.\n\nMore information:\nhttps://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby\n\n## Repeating Notifications\n\n(optional) Specify `repeatType` and optionally `repeatTime` (Android-only) while scheduling the local notification. Check the local notification example above.\n\n### iOS\nProperty `repeatType` can only be `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`.\n\nNOTE: `repeatTime` do not work with iOS.\n\n### Android\nProperty `repeatType` could be one of `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `time`. \n\nThe interval used can be configured to a different interval using `repeatTime`. If `repeatType` is `time`, `repeatTime` must be specified as the number of milliseconds between each interval.\nFor example, to configure a notification every other day\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({\n    ...\n    repeatType: 'day',\n    repeatTime: 2,\n    ...\n});\n```\n\n## Notification Actions\n\n(Android Only)\n\nThis is done by specifying an `actions` parameters while configuring the local notification. This is an array of strings where each string is a notification action that will be presented with the notification.\n\nFor e.g. `actions: ['Accept', 'Reject']`\n\nWhen you handle actions in background (`invokeApp: false`), you can open the application and pass the initial notification by using use `PushNotification.invokeApp(notification)`.\n\nMake sure you have the receiver in `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n  <receiver android:name=\"com.dieam.reactnativepushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationActions\" />\n```\n\nNotifications with inline reply: \n\nYou must register an action as \"ReplyInput\", this will show in the notifications an input to write in. \n\nEXAMPLE:\n```javascript\nPushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({\n  message: \"My Notification Message\", // (required)\n  date: new Date(Date.now() + (60 * 1000)), // in 60 secs\n  actions: [\"ReplyInput\"],\n  reply_placeholder_text: \"Write your response...\", // (required)\n  reply_button_text: \"Reply\" // (required)\n});\n```\n\nTo get the text from the notification: \n\n```javascript\n...\nif(notification.action === \"ReplyInput\"){\n  console.log(\"texto\", notification.reply_text)// this will contain the inline reply text. \n}\n...\n```\n\nFor iOS, you can use:\n\n```javascript\nPushNotification.setNotificationCategories(categories);\n```\n\nAnd use the `category` field in the notification.\n\nDocumentation [here](https://github.com/react-native-push-notification-ios/push-notification-ios#how-to-perform-different-action-based-on-user-selected-action) to add notification actions.\n\n## Set application badge icon\n\n```js\nPushNotification.setApplicationIconBadgeNumber(number: number)\n```\n\nWorks natively in iOS.\n\nUses the [ShortcutBadger](https://github.com/leolin310148/ShortcutBadger) on Android, and as such will not work on all Android devices.\n\n## Android Only Methods\n\n```js\nPushNotification.subscribeToTopic(topic: string)\n```\nSubscribe to a topic (works only with Firebase)\n\n```js\nPushNotification.unsubscribeFromTopic(topic: string)\n```\nUnsubscribe from a topic (works only with Firebase)\n\n## Android Custom Notification Handling\n\nUnlike iOS, Android apps handle the creation of their own notifications. React Native Push Notifications does a \"best guess\" to create and handle incoming notifications. However, when using 3rd party notification platforms and tools, the initial notification creation process may need to be customized.\n\n### Customizing Notification Creation\n\nIf your notification service uses a custom data payload format, React Native Push Notifications will not be able to parse the data correctly to create an initial notification.\n\nFor these cases, you should:\n\n1. Remove the intent handler configuration for React Native Push Notifications from your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.\n2. Implement initial notification creation as per the instructions from your Provider.\n\n### Handling Custom Payloads\n\nData payloads of notifications from 3rd party services may not match the format expected by React Native Push Notification. When tapped, these notifications will not pass the details and data to the `onNotification()` event handler. Custom `IntentHandlers` allow you to fix this so that correct `notification` objects are sent to your `onNotification()` method.\n\nCustom handlers are added in Application init or `MainActivity.onCreate()` methods:\n\n```java\nRNPushNotification.IntentHandlers.add(new RNPushNotification.RNIntentHandler() {\n  @Override\n  public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {\n    // If your provider requires some parsing on the intent before the data can be\n    // used, add that code here. Otherwise leave empty.\n  }\n\n  @Nullable\n  @Override\n  public Bundle getBundleFromIntent(Intent intent) {\n    // This should return the bundle data that will be serialized to the `notification.data`\n    // property sent to the `onNotification()` handler. Return `null` if there is no data\n    // or this is not an intent from your provider.\n    \n    // Example:\n    if (intent.hasExtra(\"MY_NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER_DATA_KEY\")) {\n      return intent.getBundleExtra(\"MY_NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER_DATA_KEY\");\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Checking Notification Permissions\n\n```js\nPushNotification.checkPermissions(callback: Function) //Check permissions\n```\n\n`callback` will be invoked with a `permissions` object:\n\n- `alert`: boolean\n- `badge`: boolean\n- `sound`: boolean\n\n## iOS Only Methods\n\n```js\nPushNotification.getApplicationIconBadgeNumber(callback: Function) //Get badge number\n```\n\n"

This helps give you more guidance as you code from [intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n### Recommended Development setup\n\nWe recommend the following tools for your dev setup:\n\n* Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n* Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or [hyper](https://hyper.is/)\n* PWABuilder VSCode extension: [PWABuilder VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PWABuilder.pwabuilder-extension)\n* lit-html VSCode extension: [lit-html VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html)\n\n### Development\n\nRun `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`, the starter should open in your default browser. From here you can start developing, your changes will be rebuilt and reloaded in the browser as you develop.\n\n### Building for Production\n\nRun `npm run build`, the `dist/` folder will contain your built PWA. The production build will also generate a pre-caching service worker using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching).\n\n## Deployment and Packaging\n\n### Deployment\n\nOnce your PWA is ready to deploy we recommend [Azure static website hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/) for deploying your PWA.\n\n\n### Packaging\n\nMany app stores, including the Microsoft Store and the Google Play Store support PWAs. To package your PWA for deployment to these app stores head back to https://pwabuilder.com/, put in your URL and hit `Build My PWA`.\n\n\n## Dual Screen support\n\nThe default layout of this starter is dual screen friendly. We do this [here](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter/blob/main/src/script/pages/app-home.ts#L41) by using the [CSS Spanning API](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/Foldables/explainer.md#proposal-css-primitives-for-building-dual-screen-layouts) to adjust the layout when the app is spanned on a dual screen device. As you start to build your PWA you can use these CSS features to ensure that your PWA looks good in all of the [dual screen postures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-overview). For more info on developing PWAs for dual screen devices you can check out the [Microsoft docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/cross-platform/#build-web-experiences).\n\n\n## Addons\n\n### Microsoft Graph Toolkit\n\nThe [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/overview) is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.\n\n### Authentication\n\nFor Authentication you can use the [PWABuilder pwa-auth](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-auth) web component. This component lets your users sign-in/sign-up using their Microsoft, Google, or Facebook account. Your app receives their email address, name, and profile picture. Built with ❤ by the PWABuilder team.\n\n\uD83D\uDE0E Bonus: It's super lightweight, pulling in the authentication libraries only when the user tries to sign-in with one.\n\n\uD83D\uDE0E\uD83D\uDE0E Double bonus: It uses the new [Credential Management APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management) to speed through sign-ins without bulky pop-ups or redirects.\n\n\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\npwa-starter\n│   README.md (docs)\n│   rollup.config.js (bundler config https://rollupjs.org/)\n|   tsconfig.json (TypeScript config https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n|   pwabuilder-sw.js (Service Worker https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)\n|   package.json (https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)\n|   package-lock.json (https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json)\n|   manifest.json (web manifest https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)\n|   index.prod.html (index.html file used for production builds)\n|   index.html (index.html for dev builds)\n|   *note*: The index.prod.html registers a service worker which caches assets, so index.html is used for dev builds\n|   .gitignore (git config file https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)\n│\n└───src (most of your development will happen here)\n│   │   global.css (used for global CSS styles and CSS variables)\n│   │\n│   └───script\n│       │\n│       |\n|       └───components\n|           |   header.ts (header component)\n|       |\n|       |\n|       └───pages\n|           |   app-index.ts (app-index component)\n|           |   app-home.ts (app-home component)\n|           |   app-about.ts (app-about component)\n\n```\n"

Description\n\nThis plugin allows you to authenticate and identify users with [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/) on [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/) and [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/).\nOut of the box, you'll get email, display name, given name, family name, profile picture url, and user id.\nYou can also configure it to get an [idToken](#7-exchanging-the-idtoken) and [serverAuthCode](#8-exchanging-the-serverauthcode).\n\nThis plugin only wraps access to the Google Sign-In API. Further API access should be implemented per use-case, per developer.\n\n## 2.

Google API setup\nTo communicate with Google you need to do some tedious setup, sorry.\n\nIt is (strongly) recommended that you use the same project for both iOS and Android.\n\n### Before you proceed\nGo into your `config.xml` and make sure that your package name (i.e. the app ID) is what you want it to be. Use this package name when setting up iOS and Android in the following steps! If you don't, you will likely get a 12501, 'user cancelled' error despite never cancelling the log in process.\n\nThis step is _especially_ important if you are using a framework such as Ionic to scaffold out your project. When you create the project, the `config.xml` has a placeholder packagename, e.g. com.ionic.*, so you can start developing right away.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<widget id=\"** REPLACE THIS VALUE **\" ...>\n...\n</widget>\n```\n\n### Browser\nBrowser platform require a valid `WEB_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID` that generated at [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\nEnsure you have added your url address (example: `http://localhost:3000`) to **Authorized JavaScript origins** section.\nSee [this screenshot for example](http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1508064473.png)\n\n### iOS\nTo get your iOS `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`, [generate a configuration file here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=ios&cntapi=signin).\nThis `GoogleService-Info.plist` file contains the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` you'll need during installation. _This value is only needed for iOS._\n\nThe `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` is also known as the \"iOS URL Scheme\" on the Developer's Console.\n\nLogin on iOS takes the user to a [SafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SafariServices/Reference/SFSafariViewController_Ref/) through the Google SDK, instead of the separate Safari browser.\n\n### Android\nTo configure Android, [generate a configuration file here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=android&cntapi=signin). Enable Google Sign-In and add an Android App to add the SHA1 fingerprint. Once Google Sign-In is enabled Google will automatically create necessary credentials in Developer Console for web and Android. There is no need to add the generated google-services.json file into your cordova project. You may need to configure the consent screen.\n\nMake sure you execute the `keytool` steps as explained [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/android/auth) or authentication will fail (do this for both release and debug keystores).\n\nIMPORTANT:\n* The step above, about `keytool`, show 2 types of certificate fingerprints, the **Release** and the **Debug**, when generating the configuration file, it's better to use the **Debug** certificate fingerprint, after that, you have to go on [Google Credentials Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), and manually create a credential for **OAuth2 client** with your **Release** certificate fingerprint. This is necessary to your application work on both Development and Production releases.\n* Ensure that you are using the correct alias name while generating the fingerprint.\n```\n$ keytool -exportcert -keystore <path-to-debug-or-production-keystore> -list -v -alias <alias-name>\n```\nLogin on Android will use the accounts signed in on the user's device.\n\n#### Integrating Google Play Services\n\nTo set up Google Play Services version, you can use PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION parameter (with 11.8.0 value by default). It is useful in order to avoid conflicts with another plugins which use any other different version of Google Play Service, because they MUST be the same version.\n\n#### Publishing your app in Google Play Store\n\nGoogle re-signs your app with a different certificate when you publish it in the Play Store. Once your app is published, copy the SHA-1 fingerprint of the \"App signing certificate\", found in the \"App signing\" section under \"Release Management\", in [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/). Paste this fingerprint in the Release OAuth client ID in [Google Credentials Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).\n\n### Web Client Id\n\nIf you want to get an `idToken` or `serverAuthCode` back from the Sign In Process, you will need to pass the client ID for your project's web application. This can be found on your project's API credentials page on the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\n\n## 4. Installation (PhoneGap CLI / Cordova CLI)\nThis plugin is compatible with:\n* [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman)\n* [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features)\n* [Ionic](http://ionic.io/) ***(must use the Cordova CLI)***\n* [Meteor JS](https://atmospherejs.com/hedcet/cordova-google-plus-native-sign-in)\n\nHere's how it works (backup your project first!):\n\nUsing the Cordova CLI and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-googleplus):\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-googleplus --save --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid --variable WEB_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID=mywebapplicationclientid\n$ cordova prepare\n```\n\nUsing the Cordova CLI to fetch the latest version from GitHub:\n```\n$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus --save --variable REVERSED_CLIENT_ID=myreversedclientid  --variable WEB_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID=mywebapplicationclientid\n$ cordova prepare\n```\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\n* _Please note that `myreversedclientid` is a place holder for the reversed clientId you find in your iOS configuration file. Do not surround this value with quotes. **(iOS only Applications)**_\n\n* _If you are building a hybrid application **(iOS and Android)**, or an Android application, you have to replace `myreversedclientid` with the reverse value of Client ID in your **Release** credential generated on step 3, on [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), this will be: **\"com.googleusercontent.apps.`uniqueId`\"**, without quotes. Example: '123-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com' becomes 'com.googleusercontent.apps.123-abc123'._\n\n* `myreversedclientid` is a place holder for Oauth Client ID specifically generated for web application in your [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\n\nGooglePlus.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.\n\n## 5. Installation (PhoneGap Build)\nAdd this to your config.xml:\n\nFor the (stable) NPM Version:\n```xml\n<plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-googleplus\" source=\"npm\">\n  <variable name=\"REVERSED_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"myreversedclientid\" />\n  <variable name=\"WEB_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"mywebapplicationclientid\" />\n</plugin>\n```\n\nFor the latest version from Git (not recommended):\n```xml\n<plugin spec=\"https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus.git\" source=\"git\">\n  <variable name=\"REVERSED_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"myreversedclientid\" />\n  <variable name=\"WEB_APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID\" value=\"mywebapplicationclientid\" />\n<plugin>\n```\n\n## 6. Installation (iOS and Cocoapods)\n\nThis plugin use the [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://cocoapods.org) in order to satisfy the iOS Google SignIn SDK library dependencies.\n\nTherefore please make sure you have Cocoapods installed in your iOS build environment - setup instructions can be found [here](https://cocoapods.org/). Also make sure your local Cocoapods repo is up-to-date by running `pod repo update`.\n\nIf building your project in Xcode, you need to open `YourProject.xcworkspace` (not `YourProject.xcodeproj`) so both your Cordova app project and the Pods project will be loaded into Xcode.\n\nYou can list the pod dependencies in your Cordova iOS project by installing [cocoapods-dependencies](https://github.com/segiddins/cocoapods-dependencies):\n\n```\nsudo gem install cocoapods-dependencies\ncd platforms/ios/\npod dependencies\n```\n\n## 7. Usage\nCheck the [demo app](demo) to get you going quickly, or hurt yourself and follow these steps.\n\nNote that none of these methods should be called before [`deviceready`](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/cordova/events/events.deviceready.html) has fired.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', deviceReady, false);\n\nfunction deviceReady() {\n    //I get called when everything's ready for the plugin to be called!\n    console.log('Device is ready!');\n    window.plugins.googleplus.trySilentLogin(...);\n}\n```\n\n### isAvailable\n3/31/16: This method is no longer required to be checked first. It is kept for code orthoganality.\n\n### Login\n\nThe login function walks the user through the Google Auth process. All parameters are optional, however there are a few caveats.\n\nTo get an `idToken` on Android, you ***must*** pass in your `webClientId` (a frequent mistake is to supply Android Client ID). On iOS, the `idToken` is included in the sign in result by default.\n\nTo get a `serverAuthCode`, you must pass in your `webClientId` _and_ set `offline` to true. If offline is true, but no webClientId is provided, the `serverAuthCode` will _**NOT**_ be requested.\n\nThe default scopes requested are `profile` and `email` (always requested). To request other scopes, add them as a **space-separated list** to the `scopes` parameter. They will be requested exactly as passed in. Refer to the [Google Scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes) documentation for info on valid scopes that can be requested. For example, `'scope': 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks'`.\n\nNaturally, in order to use any additional scopes or APIs, they will need to be activated in your project Developer's Console.\n\n##### Usage\n```javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.login(\n    {\n      'scopes': '... ', // optional, space-separated list of scopes, If not included or empty, defaults to `profile` and `email`.\n      'webClientId': 'client id of the web app/server side', // optional clientId of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - On Android, this MUST be included to get an idToken. On iOS, it is not required.\n      'offline': true // optional, but requires the webClientId - if set to true the plugin will also return a serverAuthCode, which can be used to grant offline access to a non-Google server\n    },\n    function (obj) {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    },\n    function (msg) {\n      alert('error: ' + msg);\n    }\n);\n```\n\nThe success callback (second argument) gets a JSON object with the following contents, with example data of my Google account:\n```javascript\n obj.email          // 'eddyverbruggen@gmail.com'\n obj.userId         // user id\n obj.displayName    // 'Eddy Verbruggen'\n obj.familyName     // 'Verbruggen'\n obj.givenName      // 'Eddy'\n obj.imageUrl       // 'http://link-to-my-profilepic.google.com'\n obj.idToken        // idToken that can be exchanged to verify user identity.\n obj.serverAuthCode // Auth code that can be exchanged for an access token and refresh token for offline access\n obj.accessToken    // OAuth2 access token\n```\n\nAdditional user information is available by use case. Add the scopes needed to the scopes option then return the info to the result object being created in the `handleSignInResult` and `didSignInForUser` functions on Android and iOS, respectively.\n\nOn Android, the error callback (third argument) receives an error status code if authentication was not successful. A description of those status codes can be found on Google's android developer website at [GoogleSignInStatusCodes](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/signin/GoogleSignInStatusCodes).\n\nOn iOS, the error callback will include an [NSError localizedDescription](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSError_Class/).\n\n### Try silent login\nYou can call `trySilentLogin` to check if they're already signed in to the app and sign them in silently if they are.\n\nIf it succeeds you will get the same object as the `login` function gets,\nbut if it fails it will not show the authentication dialog to the user.\n\nCalling `trySilentLogin` is done the same as `login`, except for the function name.\n```javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.trySilentLogin(\n    {\n      'scopes': '... ', // optional - space-separated list of scopes, If not included or empty, defaults to `profile` and `email`.\n      'webClientId': 'client id of the web app/server side', // optional - clientId of your Web application from Credentials settings of your project - On Android, this MUST be included to get an idToken. On iOS, it is not required.\n      'offline': true, // Optional, but requires the webClientId - if set to true the plugin will also return a serverAuthCode, which can be used to grant offline access to a non-Google server\n    },\n    function (obj) {\n      alert(JSON.stringify(obj)); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    },\n    function (msg) {\n      alert('error: ' + msg);\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIt is strongly recommended that trySilentLogin is implemented with the same options as login, to avoid any potential complications.\n\n### logout\nThis will clear the OAuth2 token.\n``` javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.logout(\n    function (msg) {\n      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### disconnect\nThis will clear the OAuth2 token, forget which account was used to login, and disconnect that account from the app. This will require the user to allow the app access again next time they sign in. Be aware that this effect is not always instantaneous. It can take time to completely disconnect.\n``` javascript\nwindow.plugins.googleplus.disconnect(\n    function (msg) {\n      alert(msg); // do something useful instead of alerting\n    }\n);\n```\n\n## 8. Exchanging the `idToken`\n\nGoogle Documentation for Authenticating with a Backend Server\n- [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth)\n- [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth)\n- [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/backend-auth)\n\nAs the above articles mention, the `idToken` can be exchanged for user information to confirm the users identity.\n\n_Note: Google does not want user identity data sent directly to a server. The idToken is their preferred method to send that data securely and safely, as it must be verified through their servers in order to unpack._\n\nThis has several uses. On the client-side, it can be a way to get doubly confirm the user identity, or it can be used to get details such as the email host domain. The server-side is where the `idToken` really hits its stride. It is an easy way to confirm the users identity before allowing them access to that servers resources or before exchanging the `serverAuthCode` for an access and refresh token (see the next section).\n\nIf your server-side only needs identity, and not additional account access, this is a secure and simple way to supply that information.\n\n## 9. Exchanging the `serverAuthCode`\n\nGoogle Documentation for Enabling Server-Side Access\n- [Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#handlingresponse)\n- [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/offline-access)\n- [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/offline-access)\n\nAs the above articles mention, the `serverAuthCode` is an item that can be exchanged for an access and refresh token. Unlike the `idToken`, this allows the server-side to have direct access to the users Google account.\n\nOnly in the initial login request `serverAuthCode` will be returned. If you wish to receive the token a second time, you can by using logout first.\n\nYou have a couple options when it comes to this exchange: you can use the Google REST Apis to get those in the hybrid app itself or you can send the code to your backend server to be exchanged there, using whatever method necessary (Google provides examples for Java, Python, and JS/HTTP).\n\nAs stated before, this plugin is all about user authentication and identity, so any use of the user's account beyond that needs to be implemented per use case, per application.\n\n## 10. Troubleshooting\n- Q: I can't get authentication to work on Android. And why is there no ANDROID API KEY?\n- A: On Android you need to execute the `keytool` steps, see the installation instructions for details.\n\n- Q: After following the `keytool` steps, I still can't get authentication to work on Android. I'm having a \"10 error\"!!!\n- A: You need to get the SHA 1 cert from your apk file. Run: `keytool -list -printcert -jarfile <your apk>` and copy the SHA 1 to your Android Client ID on Google Console.\n\n- Q: OMG $@#*! the Android build is failing\n- A: You need to have _Android Support Repository_ and _Android Support Library_ installed in the Android SDK manager. Make sure you're using a fairly up to date version of those.\n\n- Q: Why isn't this working on my Android Emulator???\n- A: Make sure you are using a Virtual Device running with a **Google APIs target and/or a Google APIs CPU**!\n\n- Q: I'm getting **Error 10**, what do I do?\n- A: This is likely caused by cordova not using the keystore you want to use (e.g. because you generated your own). Please check https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/#signing-an-app to read how to do this. Some have reported that you need to run `cordova clean` before running the build to resolve error 10.\n\n- Q: I'm getting **Error 16**, what do I do?\n- A: This is always a problem because the signature (or fingerprint) of your android app when signed is not added to the google console (or firebase) OAuth whitelist. Please double check if you did everything required for this. See the mini-guide below.\n\n### Error 16 & app signing mini-guide\n\nFirst, make sure you fully read and understand the [guide on App Signing from the android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing)!\n\nAfter/while reading that, double check if you did all steps 1-4 below correctly:\n\n#### 1. Make a keystore\n\nIn order to sign your app (on dev or publish) you will need to make a local keystore and key with Android Studio or via terminal. Google has a feature called \"Google Play App Signing\" where they will keep the key on their server and sign your app for you, but if you use this feature or not, **you will need a local keystore and key either way.**\n\n- If you do not use \"Google Play App Signing\" → go to 3A\n- If you _do_ use \"Google Play App Signing\" → go to 3B\n\n#### 2A. Without _Google Play App Signing_\n\nYour local keystore and key will be your official app signing key.\n\nYou will need to whitelist the following key fingerprints (in SHA1 format) in Google OAuth settings:\n\n- android default `debug.keystore` key\n- your own created keystore with its key (for App Signing)\n\n#### 2B. With _Google Play App Signing_ enabled\n\nYour local keystore and key will be your \"Upload key\" and another key for official \"App Signing key\" is created and managed by Google.\n\nYou need to whitelist the following key fingerprints (in SHA1 format) in Google Oauth settings:\n\n- android default `debug.keystore` key\n- your own created keystore with its key (for Uploading)\n- google's App Signing key\n\n#### 3. Get key fingerprints\n\nGet the above keys' fingerprints (in SHA1 format) to be able to whitelist them.\n\n#### A. Debug key\n\nFor the android default `debug.keystore` do:\n\n    keytool -exportcert -keystore /Users/myusername/.android/debug.keystore  -list -v\n\nYou will see the SHA1 fingerprint for the debug key in terminal. Copy that.\n\n#### B. App signing or Upload key\n\nFor the own created keystore with key (either for 2A or 2B) do:\n\n    keytool -exportcert -keystore /path/to/your/key/yourKeystoreFile.keystore  -list -v\n\nYou will see the SHA1 fingerprint for the debug key in terminal. Copy that.\n\n#### C. Google's App signing key\n\nOnly when _Google Play App Signing_ is enabled (for 2B). You can find the key Google will use to sign your builds in the Google Play Console.\n\n_Requirement:_ You need to have finished the basic info on your android app and then you need to upload a signed APK for internal testing. Once this is uploaded you will be able to access the following menu:\n\nGo to Release Management > App sigining. There you will see\n\n- \"App signing certificate\" and SHA-1 fingerprint\n- \"Upload certificate\" and SHA-1 fingerprint\n\nThe \"Upload\" one is (and should be) the same as key B. above. And the \"App signing certificate\" is the key that Google will use. Copy this one.\n\n#### 4. Whitelist the key fingerprints\n\nAgain we have 2 options to whitelist them. Projects that use only the _Google Cloud Platform_ or projects that use _Firebase_.\n\n#### A. Google Cloud Platform projects\n\n(In case you also use Firebase, you can skip this step)\n\n1. Go to [API & Services > credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)\n2. Create credentials > OAuth client ID\n3. choose \"android\" and insert your SHA1\n4. Repeat this for all keys (2 or 3)\n\n#### B. Firebase projects\n\n1. Go to the console > Projects settings\n2. Select your Android app at the bottom. (if you don't have any, add an android app, you can ignore the whole tutorial they give you, it's irrelevant for Cordova apps)\n3. Add the finger prints to the \"SHA certificate fingerprints\" section.\n4. Double check your Google Cloud console: [API & Services > credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and see that Firebase has added these automatically at the bottom under \"OAuth 2.0 client IDs\"\n"

    "text" : "HaxSync Open Source Release\n=======\n\nThis is the full source code for the latest version of HaxSync I had in my repository.\n\nNotes\n---\nHaxSync was written while I was a student at university with no experience actually shipping anything. It got unexpectedly big, reaching #28 on Google Play's \"Top Sold\" apps, getting over 100k installs. I became very passionate about delivering a quality product to my users and spent way too much time on creating new features and fixing bugs.\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time or resources to support HaxSync myself anymore. This does not have to be the end though, as I am releasing the source code in hopes of someone else picking up the torch. The Android community's openness was one of the things I always liked about it and in some ways I'm happy to finally participate in that openness myself.\nThe code is terribly hacky and poorly documented, but I figured I'd rather release this in its current state than endlessly delay it waiting to find time for cleanups. I promise I'm a better engineer now, so please don't judge me for how terrible parts of the source are.\n\n\n\nDependencies\n---\n* [Facebook for Android SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk)\n* [ShowcaseView](http://amlcurran.github.io/ShowcaseView/)\n* [ColorpickerPreference](https://github.com/attenzione/android-ColorPickerPreference)\n\nHaxSync does not use a build system, as I didn't have any experience with them when I wrote it. I just built it with Android Studio, but importing the project is a bit of a pain. I'd welcome a migration to a more modern build approach!\n"

Below is an example that works for both.\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.setPreferences({\n  openUrl: function(url) {\n    var safariAvailable = false;\n\n    if (window.SafariViewController) {\n      SafariViewController.isAvailable(function(available) {\n        safariAvailable = available;\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (!safariAvailable) {\n       window.open(url, '_blank', 'location=yes');\n    } else {\n      SafariViewController.show(\n        {\n          url: url,\n          barColor: \"#0000ff\", // on iOS 10+ you can change the background color as well\n          controlTintColor: \"#00ffff\", // on iOS 10+ you can override the default tintColor\n          tintColor: \"#00ffff\", // should be set to same value as controlTintColor and will be a fallback on older ios\n        },\n\n        // this success handler will be invoked for the lifecycle events 'opened', 'loaded' and 'closed'\n        function(result) {\n          console.log(result.event)\n        },\n\n        function(msg) {\n          console.log(\"Error: \" + msg);\n        }\n      );\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n- From cordova plugins registry: `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-apprate`\n- From github repository: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/pushandplay/cordova-plugin-apprate.git`\n- For phonegap build add the following to your config.xml: `<gap:plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-apprate\" />`\n\n## Integrating Google Play Core\n\nTo set up Google Play Core version, you can use PLAY_CORE_VERSION parameter (with `1.+` value by default). It is useful in order to avoid conflicts with another plugins which use any other different version of Google Play Core.\n\n## Customization and usage\n\n- Note: During development the submit button will be disabled and cannot be pressed. This is expected behavior per Apple when the app has not been downloaded from the app store. Details here: https://github.com/pushandplay/cordova-plugin-apprate/issues/182\n- Note: Using the in-app review for Android/iOS will not prompt the user, and the native review prompt will be _requested_ and not guaranteed to be shown\n\n## Options / Preferences\nThese options are available to set via the `setPreferences` method. \n\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| :------ | :---- | :------- | :----------- |\n| useLanguage | String | null | custom BCP 47 language tag |\n| displayAppName | String | '' | custom application title |\n| promptAgainForEachNewVersion | Boolean | true | show dialog again when application version will be updated |\n| usesUntilPrompt | Integer | 3 | count of runs of application before dialog will be displayed |\n| reviewType.ios | [Enum](#reviewtypeios-enum) | AppStoreReview | the type of review display to show the user on iOS |\n| reviewType.android | [Enum](#reviewtypeandroid-enum) | InAppBrowser | the type of review display to show the user on Android |\n| simpleMode | Boolean | false | enabling simplemode would display the rate dialog directly without the negative feedback filtering flow |\n| showPromptForInAppReview | boolean | true | disabling would skip displaying a rate dialog if in app review is set and available  |\n| callbacks.onButtonClicked | Function | null | call back function. called when user clicked on rate-dialog buttons |\n| callbacks.onRateDialogShow | Function | null | call back function. called when rate-dialog showing |\n| storeAppURL.ios | String | null | application id in AppStore |\n| storeAppURL.android | String | null | application URL in GooglePlay |\n| storeAppURL.windows | String | null | application URL in Windows Store |\n| storeAppURL.blackberry | String | null | application URL in AppWorld |\n| storeAppURL.windows8 | String | null | application URL in WindowsStore |\n| customLocale | Object | null | custom locale object |\n\n#### reviewType.ios [Enum]\n- `InAppReview` - Write review directly in your application (iOS 10.3+), limited to 3 prompts per year. Will fallback to 'AppStoreReview' for other iOS versions\n- `AppStoreReview` - Open the store within the app. Use this option as an alternative to inAppReview to avoid the rate action from [doing nothing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview)\n- `InAppBrowser` - Open the store using the `openUrl` preference (defaults to InAppBrowser). Be advised that WKWebView might not open the app store links\n\n#### reviewType.android [Enum]\n- `InAppReview` - Write review directly in your application. Will fallback to `InAppBrowser` if not available\n- `InAppBrowser` - Open the store using the `openUrl` preference (defaults to InAppBrowser)\n\n### In App Reviews\n\nThe `InAppReview` review type will attempt to launch a native in-app review dialog (as opposed to opening the app store).\n   \nThe native dialog is designed to maintain the privacy of the users and to prevent applications from harassing them with too many review requests. \nAs such, the dialog might or might not appear, and we will not be able to know whether it appeared, or whether the user reviewed the app or not.  \n\nSince we can't know if the dialog will be shown, and in order to comply to the requirements of Apple/Android, \nno custom prompt will be shown to the user before attempting to open the in-app review dialog.\n\nNative in-app review can only be possible under certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, a fallback method will be used see information per platform.\n\nNote: The `InAppReview` will only work on released versions. To test it our please refer to [this article](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/test)\n\n## Examples\n\nMakes sure all your calls to the plugin happen after the cordova `onDeviceReady` event has fired.\n\n### Simple Setup and Call\n\nNote: windows does not need an URL as this is done by the native code.\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.setPreferences({\n  storeAppURL: {\n      ios: '<my_app_id>',\n      android: 'market://details?id=<package_name>',\n      blackberry: 'appworld://content/[App Id]/',\n      windows8: 'ms-windows-store:Review?name=<the Package Family Name of the application>'\n  }\n});\n\nAppRate.promptForRating();\n```\n\n### Don't Call Rate Dialog Immediately\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.promptForRating(false);\n```\nIf false is not present it will ignore `usesUntilPrompt`, `promptAgainForEachNewVersion`, and the button logic, it will prompt every time.\n\n### Override Dialog Button Callback\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.setPreferences({\n  callbacks: {\n    onButtonClicked: function(buttonIndex) {\n      console.log(\"onButtonClicked -> \" + buttonIndex);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Set Custom Language\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.setPreferences({\n  useLanguage: 'ru'\n});\n```\n\n### Set Custom Locale Object\nNote: `%@` patterns in `title` and `message` will be automatically replaced with `preferences.displayAppName`\n\n```javascript\nAppRate.setPreferences({\n    customLocale: {\n      title: \"Would you mind rating %@?\",\n      message: \"It won’t take more than a minute and helps to promote our app. Thanks for your support!\",\n      cancelButtonLabel: \"No, Thanks\",\n      laterButtonLabel: \"Remind Me Later\",\n      rateButtonLabel: \"Rate It Now\",\n      yesButtonLabel: \"Yes!\",\n      noButtonLabel: \"Not really\",\n      appRatePromptTitle: 'Do you like using %@',\n      feedbackPromptTitle: 'Mind giving us some feedback?',\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Full Setup Using

The `memoized` function returns the\nstore object that caches its results:\n\n``` javascript\nvar store = require('app-store-scraper'); // regular non caching version\nvar memoized = require('app-store-scraper').memoized(); // cache with default options\nvar memoizedCustom = require('app-store-scraper').memoized({ maxAge: 1000 * 60 }); // cache with default options\n\nmemoized.app({id: 553834731}) // will make a request\n  .then(() => memoized.app({id: 553834731})); // will resolve to the cached value without requesting\n```\n\nThe options available are those supported by the [memoizee](https://github.com/medikoo/memoizee) module.\nBy default up to 1000 values are cached by each method and they expire after 5 minutes.\n"

As a result, we’re archiving the open source repository. This represents a significant “growing up” moment for GitHub Classroom as we strive to offer you the best education tools possible.\n\nWe’re making this decision for a few important reasons:\n\n1. Quality. To provide the best services to our varied and global community, we need GitHub Classroom to meet the operational excellence of GitHub.com. Continuing development internally allows us to make better use of GitHub’s internal resources, tooling, and infrastructure. \n\n2. Better support. Using GitHub Support as our primary feedback mechanism, instead of issues, allows us to assist our users in a more productive way. We can leverage the support infrastructure already in place for GitHub.com, and all user feedback can be kept in a single place. The Education team will continue to respond to all GitHub Classroom requests.\n\nGitHub Classroom will continue to evolve and improve based on your feedback. We’re growing faster than ever, and can’t wait to launch some very exciting new features in the coming months.\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or feedback, don’t hesitate to contact us at https://support.github.com/contact.\n\nThank you!\n\nThe GitHub Classroom Team\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [The workflow you use as a developer, scaled for the needs of students.](#the-workflow-you-use-as-a-developer-scaled-for-the-needs-of-students)\n- [Why try GitHub Classroom?](#why-try-classroom)\n- [Design principles](#design-principles)\n- [GitHub Classroom and the edtech ecosystem](#github-classroom-and-the-edtech-ecosystem)\n- [The technical details](#the-technical-details)\n- [Deployment](#deployment)\n- [Help wanted](#help-wanted)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n\n## The workflow you use as a developer, scaled for the needs of students.\n\nDevelopers rarely work all by themselves, on a deadline, or ship something they’ll only use once (with no idea whether it actually works).\n\nWouldn’t students be better served by showing versions of their work, iterating, checking in on milestones and showing off the final product?\n\nWith GitHub Classroom you can set up the industry-standard workflow and free up your time to focus on teaching.\n\n*GitHub Classroom is a teacher-facing tool that uses the GitHub API to enable the GitHub workflow for education.*\n\nYou create an Assignment with starter code and directions, send along one link, and students get their own “sandbox” copy of the repo to get started.\n\nSet due dates, track assignments in your teacher dashboard, or integrate other tools like testing frameworks.\n\nWith GitHub Classroom, you can spin up your course on GitHub and move on to the good stuff.\n\n[@johndbritton](https://github.com/johndbritton), [@mozzadrella](https://github.com/mozzadrella), [@d12](https://github.com/d12), [@benemdon](https://github.com/benemdon), [@srinjoym](https://github.com/srinjoym), and [@tarebyte](https://github.com/tarebyte), are all maintainers.\n\n![GitHub Classroom screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1311594/14748352/32f677b0-0887-11e6-9ac2-8aa06e4341fa.png)\n\n## Why try GitHub Classroom?\n\n*Spend more time with students, less on setup.* Students accept an assignment with one link, so you can get straight to the material.\n\n*Bootstrap group assignments in a snap.* Invite students to a shared repository, and cap the number of students per group. Use the same groups over and over again, or create new ones.\n\n*More insight into student work than ever before.* See when students accept the assignment, and access their work from the moment they start. With version control, catch when they get stuck and help them rewind.\n\n*You are in control.* Students can work individually or in groups, in public or in private. Invite teaching assistants or graders to view the assignments.\n\n*Scales for large courses with ease.* If you have a small course, GitHub Classroom will make your life easier and save you time. If you have hundreds of students, we have you covered: as many repositories as you need, and webhooks to integrate automated testing tools.\n\n*Works with your Learning Management System (LMS).* Students submit a link to their assignment repository to your learning management system. Give feedback through comments in GitHub, but keep grades in your LMS.\n\n*You’re not alone.* The experts on the GitHub Education team are here to answer any of your questions, and we’ve got [docs](https://github.com/education/classroom/tree/master/docs), best practices, and a strong community of educators to help you migrate to GitHub Classroom.\n\n*Are you super-advanced?* Do you want to build your own tools? We \uD83D\uDC96 contributions. Please check out [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Design principles\n\n*GitHub Classroom is a teacher-facing tool to simplify the educational use of GitHub.* Every student needs feedback and support as they learn to code, and using GitHub you can give them the right advice, in the right place, at the right time. GitHub Classroom makes it easier to use the workflow you love, with some automation and ease for student use.\n\n*Students use GitHub. They don’t use GitHub Classroom.* Experience with real-world tools gives students a leg-up once they move on from school. Invest time in the tools students can grow with, not another third-party tool with its own learning curve.\n\n*GitHub Classroom is not an LMS (Learning Management System).* If you need to use an LMS like Canvas, Moodle or Blackboard, we hear you. Students can post their repositories to your LMS. We’re going to stick with what we’re good at, which is helping people collaborate on code.\n\n*GitHub Classroom is open source.* Git and GitHub are versatile with many ways to meet your learning goals, and we want to model the open source process that makes our communities great.\n\nWe welcome contributions aligned with the roadmap below and through answering these questions:\n\n* Does it enable the real-life experience of using GitHub as a developer?\n* Does it replicate functionality that's best left to the expertise of content platforms, hardware or LMS?\n* How many support tickets and questions will the feature address?\n\n### Who is GitHub Classroom for?\nAnyone teaching computer science in a high school, university or informal environment.\nFolks who might also find GitHub Classroom useful:\n* Higher ed statistics and data science teachers\n* Higher ed biology and the hard sciences\n\n## GitHub Classroom and the edtech ecosystem\n\nIn case you’re wondering “How does GitHub Classroom interact with my favorite app/my notebook/my LMS” here’s the tl;dr on how those pieces fit together:\n\n*Apps and content platforms*\n\nExamples: Codecademy, Skillshare, Udemy, Udacity\n\nApps offer premium content and interactive exercises. GitHub Classroom offers *real-world experience* with code. GitHub Classroom, as a teacher-facing application will eventually surface best-in-class content for top courses (notes / lectures / problem sets) but not produce original content.\n\n*Learning Management system/LMS*\n\nExamples: Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas. Google Classroom\n\nTeachers often use a learning management system in keeping with student privacy regulations. GitHub Classroom has a lightweight integration with LMS ecosystem--students can submit a link to their repositories. LTI compliance and Google Classroom integration will make the app more extensible.\n\n*Notebooks*\n\nExamples: BlueJ, Jupyter, RStudio\n\nMost notebooks have a Git integration that students can push to. Future iterations may pre-populate repos with robust directions on set up.\n\n*Hardware*\n\nExamples: Chromebooks, Raspberry Pi, Lego\n\nGitHub Classroom runs in Unix environments and Windows. Shared machines or lab environments are encouraged to use cloud-based environments, like Cloud 9. Integration looks like Git and GitHub pre-loaded + embedded in hardware.\n\n*Assessment*\n\nExamples: Pearson, Travis CI, Circle CI\n\nFor GitHub Classroom, assessment is **directly related to the real-world experience of being a developer: your code passes tests**. Configuring folders in student repositories is a priority on the roadmap.\n\n## The technical details\nGitHub Classroom is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) application.\n\nNew to Ruby? No worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server.\n\n#### macOS\n\nIf you're using macOS and running the Homebrew package manager you're all set to go! Head down to [Setup GitHub Classroom](#setup-github-classroom)\n\n#### Linux\n\n##### Installing Docker and Docker Compose\n\nWe use Docker and docker-compose so that we don't have to setup our external dependencies on our machines.\n\nHere is the installation guide for Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/\n\n##### Installing Rbenv\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to install Ruby. We recommend using the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build).\n\n##### Install PostgreSQL\n\nIn order to install the `pg` gem you have to have PostgreSQL on your system, all you need to do is install it via your package manager of choice.\n\nIf you're running an Debian/Ubuntu based GNU/Linux for example run: `apt-get install nodejs postgresql redis-server memcached`.\n\n#### Windows\n\nWe really don't have a good story for running this on Windows, but Pull Requests are welcome :smile:\n\n### Setup GitHub Classroom\n\nWe follow the [script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) principle, so all you need to do is run:\n\n```\nscript/setup\n```\n\nOnce that's done the script will kindly remind you to fill out you `.env` file inside the repository, this is the breakdown.\n\n### Development environment variables\n\nThese values must be present in your `.env` file (created by `script/setup`).\n\nENV Variable | Description |\n:-------------------|:-----------------|\n`CLASSROOM_WEBHOOK_URL_PREFIX` | Ngrok url to receive webhooks (run `./script/ngrok`).\n`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`| the GitHub Application Client ID.\n`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`| the GitHub Application Client Secret.\n`NON_STAFF_GITHUB_ADMIN_IDS` | GitHub `user_ids` of users to be granted staff level access.\n`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | the Google Client ID\n`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | the Google Client Secret\n\nTo obtain your `GitHub Client ID/Secret` you need to [register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).\n\nAfter you register your OAuth application, you should fill in the homepage url with `http://localhost:5000` and the authorization url with `http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback`.\n\nTo obtain your GitHub User ID for the `NON_STAFF_GITHUB_ADMIN_IDS` field, go to `https://api.github.com/users/your_username`\n\nTo obtain your `Google Client ID/Secret` you will need to [create a new web application](http://console.developers.google.com). When creating credentials choose `OAuth Client ID`, then fill in the `Authorized JavaScript origins` with `http://localhost:5000` and the `Authorized redirect URIs` with `http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback`. \n\nAfter creating your Google credientials, add the Google Classroom scopes of:\n* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly`\n* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.rosters.readonly`\n\n### Testing environment variables\n\nIf you want to make a functionality change to the application you will need to write tests to accompany that change. In order to do this, the test values in the .env file must be filled in.\n\nGitHub Classroom uses [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) for recording and playing back API fixtures during test runs. These cassettes (fixtures) are part of the Git project in the `spec/support/cassettes` folder. If you're not recording new cassettes you can run the specs with existing cassettes with:\n\n```bash\nscript/test\n```\n\nGitHub Classroom uses environmental variables for storing credentials used in testing, these values are located in your `.env` file (created by `script/setup`).\nIf you are recording new cassettes, you need to make sure all of these values are present.\n\nENV Variable | Description |\n:-------------------|:-----------------|\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_GITHUB_ID` | GitHub `user_id` of an organization admin (classroom owner)\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_GITHUB_TOKEN` | [OAuth Access Token](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#creating-multiple-tokens-for-oauth-apps) for GitHub Classroom on behalf of the test classroom owner\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_STUDENT_GITHUB_ID` | GitHub `user_id` of the student\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_STUDENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | [OAuth Access Token](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#creating-multiple-tokens-for-oauth-apps) for GitHub Classroom on behalf of the test student\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_ID` | GitHub ID of classroom organization (preferably one created specifically for testing against)\n`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_LOGIN` | GitHub login of classroom organization (preferably one created specifically for testing against)\n\nTo obtain these values you will need:\n\n* A teacher (your primary GitHub account)\n* A student (another Github account, created for this purpose)\n* An organisation that the teacher is an owner of, but the student does not belong to.\n\nIt is best if you create your own organization for testing purposes, if you have done so:\n\nTo obtain the `OWNER_GITHUB_ID` value, you can go to `https://api.github.com/users/organization_owner_username`.\n\nTo obtain the `OWNER_GITHUB_TOKEN` value, you will need to log in to GitHub Classroom with the owner test account, pull up the Rails console, and copy the `token` field\n\nTo get the `STUDENT_GITHUB_ID` value you will need to create another user account on GitHub and get the ID by going to `https://api.github.com/users/student_username`\n\nTo get the `STUDENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` value, you will need to log in to GitHub Classroom with the student test account, pull up the Rails console, and copy the `token` field\n\nTo obtain the `OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_ID/LOGIN` you can go to `https://api.github.com/orgs/organization_name`.\n\nNow you should have all of the values filled in, great job!\n\n### Running the application\n\n#### Optional\nIf you'd like to receive webhooks from GitHub you can run:\n\n```bash\nscript/ngrok\n```\n\nAnd update the `WEBHOOK_URL` in your .env file.\n\nAnd if you want to play with features that are still in development run:\n\n``\n./bin/rake enable_features\n``\n\n#### Necessary\nAfter that, you may start the rails server in a separate terminal with:\n\n```bash\nscript/server\n```\n\nAaand that's it! You should have a working instance of GitHub Classroom located [here](http://localhost:5000)\n\n#### Debugging\nWe use [pry-rails](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails) and [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) for debugging. But since we use `overmind` in the development environment, debugging via `byebug` or via `binding.pry` requires a few more steps:\n\n* Once you start your server using `script/server`, `overmind` will start tmux processes depending on the `Procfile`.\n* We have two such processes `rails` and `sidekiq` (See `Procfile.dev` for details) that you can control.\n* Once you've added a debugging statement in the code and your request pauses, you can access console in a separate tab/window using the following command:\n  * `overmind connect rails` for debugging in request-response cycle, typically controllers, models, services.\n  * `overmind connect sidekiq` for debugging in background jobs.\n* After you've finished debugging you can close the connection using `Ctrl+b d`.\n\nFor more details please visit `overmind` homepage: https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind\n\n## Deployment\nWe strongly encourage you to use [https://classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com), but if you would like your own version GitHub Classroom can be easily deployed to Heroku.\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\n\nThere are a few environment variables you will need to know in order to get GitHub Classroom working on production.\n\n### Production environment variables\n\nENV Variable | Description |\n:-------------------|:-----------------|\n`CANONICAL_HOST` | the preferred hostname for the application, if set requests served on other hostnames will be redirected\n`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID` | identifier for Google Analytics in the format `UA-.*`\n`PINGLISH_ENABLED` | Enable the `/_ping` endpoint with relevant health checks\n`MOTD` | Show the message of the day banner at the top of the site\n\n## Help wanted\nIf you're interested in helping out with GitHub Classroom development and looking for a place to get started, check out the issues labeled [`help-wanted`](https://github.com/education/classroom/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted+%3Araised_hand_with_fingers_splayed%3A%22) and feel free to ask any questions you have before diving into the code.\n\n## Contributors\nGitHub Classroom is developed by these [contributors](https://github.com/education/classroom/graphs/contributors).\n\nShout out to [GitHub Summer of Code](https://github.com/blog/1970-students-work-on-open-source-with-github-this-summer) student, [Mark Tareshawty](http://marktareshawty.com), from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) for his work on GitHub Classroom.\n"

    "text" : "# Social Media Queries\n\nA collection of SQL queries to social media datasets. The queries return answers like \"Most mentioned books on Hacker News\", \"Top apps on Reddit\", and others. See the [list of queries](#queries) and [how to use them](#usage) below\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Reports](#reports)\n* [Queries](#queries)\n* [Usage](#usage)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n\n\n## Reports\n\nDirectory [`reports`](reports/) features showcases:\n\n* [Top Hacker News Submissions by Year](reports/hackernews-top-submissions-by-year.md)\n* [Top 100 \"Show HN\" Projects](reports/hackernews-top-show-hn-100.md)\n* [Top HN Authors by H-Index](reports/hackernews-top-authors-by-h-index.md)\n* [Top Reddit Submissions by Year](https://github.com/antontarasenko/smq/blob/master/reports/reddit-top-submissions-by-year.md)\n* [Top Reddit IAmA by Year](reports/reddit-top-iama-by-year.md)\n\nCheck [`reports`](reports/) for more.\n\n\n## Queries\n\nQueries are written for Google BigQuery [free public datasets](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/) (requires a Google account) and stored in `.sql` files, organized by social media outlet (folder `hackernews` and so on). These datasets are snapshots taken on particular dates, so results do not include post-2015 content.\n\nEach of the queries processes 0.5-10GB of data. Processing up to 1TB per month is free, and you have up to 2,000 queries to experiment with.\n\n### [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)\n\nSome examples (see [`hackernews` directory](hackernews/) for the full list):\n\n* [Most cited books (comments)](hackernews/amazon-books-in-text.sql) - Using links to Amazon.com as citations. Don't include text references. Also see [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10924741). This and the three next queries can be extended to other items. Examples:\n  - Movies on Internet Movie Database: `imdb.com/title/tt[0-9]+/`\n  - Books on iTunes: `itunes.apple.com/book/id[0-9]+`\n  - Apps on Google Play: `play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=.+`\n* [Most cited books (submissions)](hackernews/amazon-books-in-url.sql) - The same, but this counts submitted URLs.\n* [Popular iTunes Apps (comments)](hackernews/itunes-apps-in-text.sql) - Like \"Most cited books\", but this tracks links to Apple Store. \n* [Popular iTunes Apps (submissions)](hackernews/itunes-apps-in-url.sql) - Similarly.\n* [Social network (graph)](hackernews/social-network.sql) - A weighted directional graph based on users commenting each other. Weights correspond to the number of comments one user left to another. See [Social network analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis) for more information.\n* [Top authors by median](hackernews/top-authors-median.sql) - List of authors based on the median score. A quick way to find founders and VCs submitting to HN.\n* [Top authors by mean](hackernews/top-authors-mean.sql) - Based on the mean score. Usually implies many low-scored posts with major hits due to the skewed distribution.\n* [Top news sources](hackernews/top-news-sources.sql) - Where most popular news come from? Separated by day of week and hour.\n* [Popular Wikipedia articles](hackernews/wikipedia-pages-in-url.sql) - Counting links to Wikipedia articles.\n\nFor simple queries, use Hacker News' Algolia search:\n\n* [All-time stories ranked by score](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)\n* [\"Show HN\" by score](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=show%20hn&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)\n* [\"Ask HN\" by score](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=ask%20hn&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)\n* [Comments ranked by score](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=comment)\n\n### [Reddit](http://reddit.com/)\n\nAll Hacker News queries can be applied to Reddit after minor edits. Examples:\n\n* [Top authors by median](reddit/top-authors-median.sql) - Authors ranked by the median score with minor adjustments. Expect no poor content from them.\n* [Top sources of political news](reddit/posts-top-domains.sql) - Ranking sources submitted to [r/politics](http://reddit.com/r/politics).\n\nReddit comments on BigQuery are split into multiple tables. If you want to select from comments, use `TABLE_QUERY`:\n\n  `FROM (TABLE_QUERY([fh-bigquery:reddit_comments], \"table_id BETWEEN '2007' AND '2014' OR table_id CONTAINS '2015_' OR table_id CONTAINS '2016_'\"))`.\n\nBeware, this can quickly exhaust the free 1TB limit.\n\n### [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)\n\n* [Edits made from an IP address](wikipedia/edits-by-organization.sql) - Wikipedia records IP addresses of anonymous editors. With respect to privacy, some uses of this data: \n  - Edits by organization. Many organizations reserve static IPs. One famous example is [US Congress' edits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congressional_staff_edits_to_Wikipedia). This query is unlikely to return many edits done by a particular organization because the sample table contains only 300M edits. Too diluted to have a representative subset. \n  - Edits by region. The sample is sufficient for statistics by region and other broad characteristics.\n\n### [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/)\n\nStack Exchange has its own query system at [http://data.stackexchange.com/](data.stackexchange.com). Check their [top queries](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries?order_by=favorite) and [try](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) your own. [This post](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede) describes the variables.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Web Interface\n\nYou can export up to 16,000 rows or 10MB as a `csv` file via web interface. Larger output can be exported through console. Add `LIMIT <n>` to queries to control the number of rows in output.  \n\n1. Locate a query in the repo's folder\n2. Login at <https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/welcome>\n3. Press \"Compose query\" in the top left corner\n4. Copy-paste the query and run it\n\nSee [web UI quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/web-ui-quickstart) by Google.\n\n### Command line: `bq`\n\n1. Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)\n2. Initialize your account for [command line tools](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bq-command-line-tool)\n3. Run ``bq query `cat <path>` ``, where `<path>` leads to the `.sql` file\n\n### Python in clouds: Jupyter, IPython notebooks\n\n1. Get a Google Cloud account ([free trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial))\n2. Create a Jupyter notebook in [Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/)\n3. Do `import gcp.bigquery as bq`\n4. Run queries with `bq.Query()` function\n\nSee Felipe Hoffa's [Hacker News notebook](https://github.com/fhoffa/notebooks/blob/master/analyzing%20hacker%20news.ipynb) for example.\n\n### BigQuery API\n\nSee [BigQuery API Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bigquery-api-quickstart) for examples in Java, Python, C#, PHP, Ruby. You'll need a [credentials file](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) to run it locally.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcomed. Suggestions:\n\n* Adding new queries\n* Adapting `.sql` files for Hacker News to Reddit and Wikipedia datasets\n* Adding new types of reports to the [`reports`](reports/) section \n\nThe [reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-reference) for BigQuery's SQL dialect.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* [Felipe Hoffa](https://twitter.com/felipehoffa) for publishing the datasets\n* Discussions on Hacker News and Reddit.

If none match, play the first track.\n\"disabled\" | N/A | Turn off audio\n\"title\" | string | Play the audio track with the title specified as the Value, e.g. \"French\"\n\"language\" | string | Play the audio track with the language specified as the Value, e.g. \"fr\"\n\"index\" | number | Play the audio track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0\n\nIf a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, the first audio track will be played. If multiple tracks match the criteria, the first match will be used.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, iOS\n\n#### selectedTextTrack\nConfigure which text track (caption or subtitle), if any, is shown.\n\n```\nselectedTextTrack={{\n  type: Type,\n  value: Value\n}}\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nselectedTextTrack={{\n  type: \"title\",\n  value: \"English Subtitles\"\n}}\n```\n\nType | Value | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n\"system\" (default) | N/A | Display captions only if the system preference for captions is enabled\n\"disabled\" | N/A | Don't display a text track\n\"title\" | string | Display the text track with the title specified as the Value, e.g. \"French 1\"\n\"language\" | string | Display the text track with the language specified as the Value, e.g. \"fr\"\n\"index\" | number | Display the text track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0\n\nBoth iOS & Android (only 4.4 and higher) offer Settings to enable Captions for hearing impaired people. If \"system\" is selected and the Captions Setting is enabled, iOS/Android will look for a caption that matches that customer's language and display it. \n\nIf a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, no text track will be displayed. If multiple tracks match the criteria, the first match will be used.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, iOS\n\n#### selectedVideoTrack\nConfigure which video track should be played. By default, the player uses Adaptive Bitrate Streaming to automatically select the stream it thinks will perform best based on available bandwidth.\n\n```\nselectedVideoTrack={{\n  type: Type,\n  value: Value\n}}\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nselectedVideoTrack={{\n  type: \"resolution\",\n  value: 480\n}}\n```\n\nType | Value | Description\n--- | --- | ---\n\"auto\" (default) | N/A | Let the player determine which track to play using ABR\n\"disabled\" | N/A | Turn off video\n\"resolution\" | number | Play the video track with the height specified, e.g. 480 for the 480p stream\n\"index\" | number | Play the video track with the index specified as the value, e.g. 0\n\nIf a track matching the specified Type (and Value if appropriate) is unavailable, ABR will be used.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer\n\n#### source\nSets the media source. You can pass an asset loaded via require or an object with a uri.\n\nSetting the source will trigger the player to attempt to load the provided media with all other given props. Please be sure that all props are provided before/at the same time as setting the source.\n\nRendering the player component with a null source will init the player, and start playing once a source value is provided.\n\nProviding a null source value after loading a previous source will stop playback, and clear out the previous source content.\n\nThe docs for this prop are incomplete and will be updated as each option is investigated and tested.\n\n\n##### Asset loaded via require\n\nExample: \n```\nconst sintel = require('./sintel.mp4');\n\nsource={sintel}\n```\n\n##### URI string\n\nA number of URI schemes are supported by passing an object with a `uri` attribute.\n\n###### Web address (http://, https://)\n\nExample:\n```\nsource={{uri: 'https://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_10mb.mp4' }}\n```\n\nPlatforms: all\n\n###### File path (file://)\n\nExample:\n```\nsource={{ uri: 'file:///sdcard/Movies/sintel.mp4' }}\n```\n\nNote: Your app will need to request permission to read external storage if you're accessing a file outside your app.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, possibly others\n\n###### iPod Library (ipod-library://)\n\nPath to a sound file in your iTunes library. Typically shared from iTunes to your app.\n\nExample:\n```\nsource={{ uri: 'ipod-library:///path/to/music.mp3' }}\n```\n\nNote: Using this feature adding an entry for NSAppleMusicUsageDescription to your Info.plist file as described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)\n\nPlatforms: iOS\n\n##### Explicit mimetype for the stream\n\nProvide a member `type` with value (`mpd`/`m3u8`/`ism`) inside the source object.\nSometimes is needed when URL extension does not match with the mimetype that you are expecting, as seen on the next example. (Extension is .ism -smooth streaming- but file served is on format mpd -mpeg dash-)\n\nExample:\n```\nsource={{ uri: 'http://host-serving-a-type-different-than-the-extension.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)',\ntype: 'mpd' }}\n```\n\n###### Other protocols\n\nThe following other types are supported on some platforms, but aren't fully documented yet:\n`content://, ms-appx://, ms-appdata://, assets-library://`\n\n\n#### stereoPan\nAdjust the balance of the left and right audio channels.  Any value between –1.0 and 1.0 is accepted.\n* **-1.0** - Full left\n* **0.0 (default)** - Center\n* **1.0** - Full right\n\nPlatforms: Android MediaPlayer\n\n#### textTracks\nLoad one or more \"sidecar\" text tracks. This takes an array of objects representing each track. Each object should have the format:\n\nProperty | Description\n--- | ---\ntitle | Descriptive name for the track\nlanguage | 2 letter [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) representing the language\ntype | Mime type of the track<br> * TextTrackType.SRT - SubRip (.srt)<br> * TextTrackType.TTML - TTML (.ttml)<br> * TextTrackType.VTT - WebVTT (.vtt)<br>iOS only supports VTT, Android ExoPlayer supports all 3\nuri | URL for the text track. Currently, only tracks hosted on a webserver are supported\n\nOn iOS, sidecar text tracks are only supported for individual files, not HLS playlists. For HLS, you should include the text tracks as part of the playlist.\n\nNote: Due to iOS limitations, sidecar text tracks are not compatible with Airplay. If textTracks are specified, AirPlay support will be automatically disabled.\n\nExample:\n```\nimport { TextTrackType }, Video from 'react-native-video';\n\ntextTracks={[\n  {\n    title: \"English CC\",\n    language: \"en\",\n    type: TextTrackType.VTT, // \"text/vtt\"\n    uri: \"https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/subtitles/subtitles_en.vtt\"\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"Spanish Subtitles\",\n    language: \"es\",\n    type: TextTrackType.SRT, // \"application/x-subrip\"\n    uri: \"https://durian.blender.org/wp-content/content/subtitles/sintel_es.srt\"\n  }\n]}\n```\n\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, iOS\n\n#### trackId\nConfigure an identifier for the video stream to link the playback context to the events emitted.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer\n\n#### useTextureView\nControls whether to output to a TextureView or SurfaceView.\n\nSurfaceView is more efficient and provides better performance but has two limitations:\n* It can't be animated, transformed or scaled\n* You can't overlay multiple SurfaceViews\n\nuseTextureView can only be set at same time you're setting the source.\n\n* **true (default)** - Use a TextureView\n* **false** - Use a SurfaceView\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer\n\n#### volume\nAdjust the volume.\n* **1.0 (default)** - Play at full volume\n* **0.0** - Mute the audio\n* **Other values** - Reduce volume\n\nPlatforms: all\n\n\n### Event props\n\n#### onAudioBecomingNoisy\nCallback function that is called when the audio is about to become 'noisy' due to a change in audio outputs. Typically this is called when audio output is being switched from an external source like headphones back to the internal speaker.

This is when the poster is removed.\n\nPayload: none\n\n* iOS: [readyForDisplay](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avplayerviewcontroller/1615830-readyfordisplay?language=objc)\n* Android: [MEDIA_INFO_VIDEO_RENDERING_START](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#MEDIA_INFO_VIDEO_RENDERING_START)\n* Android ExoPlayer [STATE_READY](https://exoplayer.dev/doc/reference/com/google/android/exoplayer2/Player.html#STATE_READY)\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS, Web\n\n#### onPictureInPictureStatusChanged\nCallback function that is called when picture in picture becomes active or inactive.\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nisActive | boolean | Boolean indicating whether picture in picture is active\n\nExample:\n```\n{\nisActive: true\n}\n```\n\nPlatforms:  iOS\n\n#### onPlaybackRateChange\nCallback function that is called when the rate of playback changes - either paused or starts/resumes.\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nplaybackRate | number | 0 when playback is paused, 1 when playing at normal speed. Other values when playback is slowed down or sped up\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  playbackRate: 0, // indicates paused\n}\n```\n\nPlatforms: all\n\n\n#### onProgress\nCallback function that is called every progressUpdateInterval milliseconds with info about which position the media is currently playing.\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\ncurrentTime | number | Current position in seconds\nplayableDuration | number | Position to where the media can be played to using just the buffer in seconds\nseekableDuration | number | Position to where the media can be seeked to in seconds. Typically, the total length of the media\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  currentTime: 5.2,\n  playableDuration: 34.6,\n  seekableDuration: 888\n}\n```\n\nPlatforms: all\n\n#### onSeek\nCallback function that is called when a seek completes.\n\nPayload:\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\ncurrentTime | number | The current time after the seek\nseekTime | number | The requested time\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  currentTime: 100.5\n  seekTime: 100\n}\n```\n\nBoth the currentTime & seekTime are reported because the video player may not seek to the exact requested position in order to improve seek performance.\n\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS, Windows UWP\n\n#### onRestoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop\nCallback function that corresponds to Apple's [`restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopWithCompletionHandler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avpictureinpicturecontrollerdelegate/1614703-pictureinpicturecontroller?language=objc). Call `restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted` inside of this function when done restoring the user interface. \n\nPayload: none\n\nPlatforms: iOS\n\n#### onTimedMetadata\nCallback function that is called when timed metadata becomes available\n\nPayload:\n\nProperty | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nmetadata | array | Array of metadata objects\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n  metadata: [\n    { value: 'Streaming Encoder', identifier: 'TRSN' },\n    { value: 'Internet Stream', identifier: 'TRSO' },\n    { value: 'Any Time You Like', identifier: 'TIT2' }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSupport for timed metadata on Android MediaPlayer is limited at best and only compatible with some videos. It requires a target SDK of 23 or higher.\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS\n\n### Methods\nMethods operate on a ref to the Video element. You can create a ref using code like:\n```\nreturn (\n  <Video source={...}\n    ref={ref => (this.player = ref)} />\n);\n```\n\n#### dismissFullscreenPlayer\n`dismissFullscreenPlayer()`\n\nTake the player out of fullscreen mode.\n\nExample:\n```\nthis.player.dismissFullscreenPlayer();\n```\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS\n\n#### presentFullscreenPlayer\n`presentFullscreenPlayer()`\n\nPut the player in fullscreen mode.\n\nOn iOS, this displays the video in a fullscreen view controller with controls.\n\nOn Android ExoPlayer & MediaPlayer, this puts the navigation controls in fullscreen mode. It is not a complete fullscreen implementation, so you will still need to apply a style that makes the width and height match your screen dimensions to get a fullscreen video.\n\nExample:\n```\nthis.player.presentFullscreenPlayer();\n```\n\nPlatforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS\n\n#### save\n`save(): Promise`\n\nSave video to your Photos with current filter prop. Returns promise.\n\nExample:\n```\nlet response = await this.player.save();\nlet path = response.uri;\n```\n\nNotes:\n - Currently only supports highest quality export\n - Currently only supports MP4 export\n - Currently only supports exporting to user's cache directory with a generated UUID filename. \n - User will need to remove the saved video through their Photos app\n - Works with cached videos as well. (Checkout video-caching example)\n - If the video is has not began buffering (e.g. there is no internet connection) then the save function will throw an error.\n - If the video is buffering then the save function promise will return after the video has finished buffering and processing.\n\nFuture: \n - Will support multiple qualities through options\n - Will support more formats in the future through options\n - Will support custom directory and file name through options\n\nPlatforms: iOS\n\n#### restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted\n`restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted(restored)`\n\nThis function corresponds to the completion handler in Apple's [restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit/avpictureinpicturecontrollerdelegate/1614703-pictureinpicturecontroller?language=objc). IMPORTANT: This function must be called after `onRestoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStop` is called. \n\nExample:\n```\nthis.player.restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopCompleted(true);\n```\n\nPlatforms: iOS\n\n#### seek()\n`seek(seconds)`\n\nSeek to the specified position represented by seconds. seconds is a float value.\n\n`seek()` can only be called after the `onLoad` event has fired. Once completed, the [onSeek](#onseek) event will be called.\n\nExample:\n```\nthis.player.seek(200); // Seek to 3 minutes, 20 seconds\n```\n\nPlatforms: all\n\n##### Exact seek\n\nBy default iOS seeks within 100 milliseconds of the target position. If you need more accuracy, you can use the seek with tolerance method:\n\n`seek(seconds, tolerance)`\n\ntolerance is the max distance in milliseconds from the seconds position that's allowed. Using a more exact tolerance can cause seeks to take longer. If you want to seek exactly, set tolerance to 0.\n\nExample:\n```\nthis.player.seek(120, 50); // Seek to 2 minutes with +/- 50 milliseconds accuracy\n```\n\nPlatforms: iOS\n\n\n\n\n### iOS App Transport Security\n\n- By default, iOS will only load encrypted (https) urls. If you want to load content from an unencrypted (http) source, you will need to modify your Info.plist file and add the following entry:\n\n<img src=\"./docs/AppTransportSecuritySetting.png\" width=\"50%\">\n\nFor more detailed info check this [article](https://cocoacasts.com/how-to-add-app-transport-security-exception-domains)\n</details>\n\n### Audio Mixing\n\nAt some point in the future, react-native-video will include an Audio Manager for configuring how videos mix with other apps playing sounds on the device.\n\nOn iOS, if you would like to allow other apps to play music over your video component, make the following change:\n\n**AppDelegate.m**\n\n```objective-c\n#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>  // import\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n  ...\n  [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient error:nil];  // allow\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the [ignoreSilentSwitch](#ignoresilentswitch) prop.\n</details>\n\n### Android Expansion File Usage\nExpansions files allow you to ship assets that exceed the 100MB apk size limit and don't need to be updated each time you push an app update.\n\nThis only supports mp4 files and they must not be compressed. Example command line for preventing compression:\n```bash\nzip -r -n .mp4 *.mp4 player.video.example.com\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Within your render function, assuming you have a file called\n// \"background.mp4\" in your expansion file. Just add your main and (if applicable) patch version\n<Video source={{uri: \"background\", mainVer: 1, patchVer: 0}} // Looks for .mp4 file (background.mp4) in the given expansion version.\n       resizeMode=\"cover\"           // Fill the whole screen at aspect ratio.\n       style={styles.backgroundVideo} />\n```\n\n### Load files with the RN Asset System\n\nThe asset system [introduced in RN `0.14`](http://www.reactnative.com/react-native-v0-14-0-released/) allows loading image resources shared across iOS and Android without touching native code. As of RN `0.31` [the same is true](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/91ff6868a554c4930fd5fda6ba8044dbd56c8374) of mp4 video assets for Android. As of [RN `0.33`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.33.0) iOS is also supported. Requires `react-native-video@0.9.0`.\n\n```javascript\n<Video\n  source={require('../assets/video/turntable.mp4')}\n/>\n```\n\n### Play in background on iOS\n\nTo enable audio to play in background on iOS the audio session needs to be set to `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback`. See [Apple documentation][3] for additional details. (NOTE: there is now a ticket to [expose this as a prop]( https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video/issues/310) )\n\n## Examples\n\n- See an [Example integration][1] in `react-native-login` *note that this example uses an older version of this library, before we used `export default` -- if you use `require` you will need to do `require('react-native-video').default` as per instructions above.*\n- Try the included [VideoPlayer example][2] yourself:\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone git@github.com:react-native-community/react-native-video.git\n   cd react-native-video/example\n   npm install\n   open ios/VideoPlayer.xcodeproj\n\n   ```\n\n   Then `Cmd+R` to start the React Packager, build and run the project in the simulator.\n\n- [Lumpen Radio](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpen-radio) contains another example integration using local files and full screen background video.\n\n## Updating\n\n### Version 5.0.0\n\nProbably you want to update your gradle version:\n#### gradle-wrapper.properties\n```diff\n- distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.3-all.zip\n+ distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.1.1-all.zip\n```\n\n#### **android/app/build.gradle**\n\nFrom version >= 5.0.0, you have to apply this changes:\n\n```diff\ndependencies {\n   ...\n    compile project(':react-native-video')\n+   implementation \"androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0\"\n-   implementation \"com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${rootProject.ext.supportLibVersion}\"\n\n}\n```\n\n#### **android/gradle.properties**\n\nMigrating to AndroidX (needs version >= 5.0.0):\n\n```gradle.properties\nandroid.useAndroidX=true\nandroid.enableJetifier=true\n```\n\n### Version 4.0.0\n\n#### Gradle 3 and target SDK 26 requirement\nIn order to support ExoPlayer 2.9.0, you must use version 3 or higher of the Gradle plugin. This is included by default in React Native 0.57.\n\n#### ExoPlayer 2.9.0 Java 1.8 requirement\nExoPlayer 2.9.0 uses some Java 1.8 features, so you may need to enable support for Java 1.8 in your app/build.gradle file. If you get an error, compiling with ExoPlayer like:\n`Default interface methods are only supported starting with Android N (--min-api 24)`\n\nAdd the following to your app/build.gradle file:\n```\nandroid {\n   ... // Various other settings go here\n   compileOptions {\n     targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n   }\n}\n```\n\n#### ExoPlayer no longer detaches\nWhen using a router like the react-navigation TabNavigator, switching between tab routes would previously cause ExoPlayer to detach causing the video player to pause. We now don't detach the view, allowing the video to continue playing in a background tab. This matches the behavior for iOS. Android MediaPlayer will crash if it detaches when switching routes, so its behavior has not been changed.\n\n#### useTextureView now defaults to true\nThe SurfaceView, which ExoPlayer has been using by default has a number of quirks that people are unaware of and often cause issues. This includes not supporting animations or scaling. It also causes strange behavior if you overlay two videos on top of each other, because the SurfaceView will [punch a hole](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView) through other views. Since TextureView doesn't have these issues and behaves in the way most developers expect, it makes sense to make it the default.\n\nTextureView is not as fast as SurfaceView, so you may still want to enable SurfaceView support. To do this, you can set `useTextureView={false}`.\n\n\n### Version 3.0.0\n\n#### All platforms now auto-play\nPreviously, on Android ExoPlayer if the paused prop was not set, the media would not automatically start playing. The only way it would work was if you set `paused={false}`. This has been changed to automatically play if paused is not set so that the behavior is consistent across platforms.\n\n#### All platforms now keep their paused state when returning from the background\nPreviously, on Android MediaPlayer if you setup an AppState event when the app went into the background and set a paused prop so that when you returned to the app the video would be paused it would be ignored.\n\nNote, Windows does not have a concept of an app going into the background, so this doesn't apply there.\n\n#### Use Android target SDK 27 by default\nVersion 3.0 updates the Android build tools and SDK to version 27. React Native is in the process of [switchting over](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18095#issuecomment-395596130) to SDK 27 in preparation for Google's requirement that new Android apps [use SDK 26](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html) by August 2018.\n\nYou will either need to install the version 27 SDK and version 27.0.3 buildtools or modify your build.gradle file to configure react-native-video to use the same build settings as the rest of your app as described below.\n\n##### Using app build settings\nYou will need to create a `project.ext` section in the top-level build.gradle file (not app/build.gradle). Fill in the values from the example below using the values found in your app/build.gradle file.\n```\n// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.\n\nbuildscript {\n    ... // Various other settings go here\n}\n\nallprojects {\n    ... // Various other settings go here\n\n    project.ext {\n        compileSdkVersion = 23\n        buildToolsVersion = \"23.0.1\"\n\n        minSdkVersion = 16\n        targetSdkVersion = 22\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you encounter an error `Could not find com.android.support:support-annotations:27.0.0.` reinstall your Android Support Repository.\n\n## TODOS\n\n- [ ] Add support for playing multiple videos in a sequence (will interfere with current `repeat` implementation)\n- [x] Callback to get buffering progress for remote videos\n- [ ] Bring API closer to HTML5 `<Video>` [reference](http://devdocs.io/html/element/video)\n\n[1]: https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-login/blob/56c47a5d1e23781e86e19b27e10427fd6391f666/App/Screens/UserInfoScreen.js#L32-L35\n[2]: https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/tree/master/examples\n[3]: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1668/_index.html\n[4]: https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/workflows/ci/badge.svg\n[5]: https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/actions\n\n---\n\n**MIT Licensed**\n"

See the [deployment notes](#deployment) for recommendations on how to deploy the project for production. Nakama server requires CockroachDB or another Postgres wire-compatible server as it's database.\n\n### Docker\n\n<a href=\"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Docker_%28container_engine%29_logo.png\" width=\"170\"></a>\n\nThe fastest way to run the server and the database is with Docker. Setup Docker and start the daemon.\n\n1. Set up a [docker-compose file](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart/#using-docker-compose) and place it in a folder for your project.\n\n2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up` to download container images and run the servers.\n\nFor more detailed instructions have a look at our [Docker quickstart](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-docker-quickstart) guide.\n\nNakama Docker images are maintained on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama/tags) and [prerelease](https://hub.docker.com/r/heroiclabs/nakama-prerelease/tags) images are occasionally published for cutting edge features of the server.\n\n### Binaries\n\nYou can run the servers with native binaries for your platform.\n\n1. Download the server from our [releases](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/releases) page and the [database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb.html).\n\n2. Follow the database [instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) to start it.\n\n3. Run a migration which will setup or upgrade the database schema:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama migrate up --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\n4. Start Nakama and connect to the database:\n\n   ```shell\n   nakama --database.address \"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"\n   ```\n\nWhen connected you'll see server output which describes all settings the server uses for [configuration](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/install-configuration).\n\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Node\",\"name\":\"nakama\",\"version\":\"2.0.0+7e18b09\",\"runtime\":\"go1.10.1\",\"cpu\":4} <br/>\n> {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2018-04-29T10:14:41.249+0100\",\"msg\":\"Database connections\",\"dsns\":[\"root@127.0.0.1:26257\"]} <br/>\n> ...\n\n## Usage\n\nNakama supports a variety of protocols optimized for various gameplay or app use cases. For request/response it can use GRPC or the HTTP1.1+JSON fallback (REST). For realtime communication you can use WebSockets or rUDP.\n\nFor example with the REST API to authenticate a user account with a device identifier.\n\n```shell\ncurl \"127.0.0.1:7350/v2/account/authenticate/device?create=true\" \\\n  --user \"defaultkey:\" \\\n  --data '{\"id\": \"someuniqueidentifier\"}'\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n> { <br>\n>     \"token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjQ5OTU2NDksInVpZCI6Ijk5Y2Q1YzUyLWE5ODgtNGI2NC04YThhLTVmMTM5YTg4MTgxMiIsInVzbiI6InhBb1RxTUVSdFgifQ.-3_rXNYx3Q4jKuS7RkxeMWBzMNAm0vl93QxzRI8p_IY\" <br>\n> }\n\nThere's a number of official [client libraries](https://github.com/heroiclabs) available on GitHub with [documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs). The current platform/language support includes: .NET (in C#), Unity engine, JavaScript, Java (with Android), Unreal engine, Godot, Defold, and Swift (with iOS). If you'd like to contribute a client or request one let us know.\n\n## Nakama Console\n\nThe server provides a web UI which teams can use to inspect various data stored through the server APIs, view lightweight service metrics, manage player data, update storage objects, restrict access to production with permission profiles, and gain visibility into realtime features like active multiplayer matches. There is no separate installation required as it is embedded as part of the single server binary.\n\nYou can navigate to it on your browser on [http://127.0.0.1:7351](http://127.0.0.1:7351).\n\n<img src=\".github/accounts.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Account listing\" width=\"1024\" align=\"center\">\n<img src=\".github/status.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Status view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/storage.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Storage record view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/match.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Running matches view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/users.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Console users view\" width=\"125\" align=\"left\">\n<img src=\".github/modules.jpg?raw=true\" title=\"Loaded modules view\" width=\"125\">\n\n## Deployment\n\nNakama can be deployed to any cloud provider such as Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, or your own private cloud. You should setup and provision separate nodes for Nakama and CockroachDB.\n\nThe recommended minimum production infrastructure for CockroachDB is outlined in [these docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations) and Nakama can be run on instance types as small as \"g1-small\" on Google Cloud although we recommend a minimum of \"n1-standard-1\" in production. The specific hardware requirements will depend on what features of the server are used. Reach out to us for help and advice on what servers to run.\n\n### Heroic Cloud\n\nYou can support development, new features, and maintainance of the server by using the Heroic Labs' [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) for deployment. This service handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.\n\nHave a look at our [Heroic Cloud](https://heroiclabs.com/heroic-cloud/) service for more details.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe development roadmap is managed as GitHub issues and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested to add a feature which is not mentioned on the issue tracker please open one to create a discussion or drop in and discuss it in the [community forum](https://forum.heroiclabs.com).\n\n### Simple Builds\n\nAll dependencies required for a build are vendored as part of the Go project. We recommend a modern release of the Go toolchain and do not store the codebase in the old GOPATH.\n\n1. Download the source tree.\n\n   ```shell\n   git clone \"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama\" nakama\n   cd nakama\n   ```\n\n2. Build the project from source.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ./nakama --version\n   ```\n\n### Full Source Builds\n\nThe codebase uses Protocol Buffers, GRPC, GRPC-Gateway, and the OpenAPI spec as part of the project. These dependencies are generated as sources and committed to the repository to simplify builds for contributors.\n\nTo build the codebase and generate all sources follow these steps.\n\n1. Install the toolchain.\n\n   ```shell\n   go install \\\n       \"google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go\" \\\n       \"google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway\" \\\n       \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2\"\n   ```\n\n2. If you've made changes to the embedded Console.\n\n    ```shell\n    cd console/ui\n    ng serve\n    ```\n\n3. Re-generate the protocol buffers, gateway code and console UI.\n\n   ```shell\n   env PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\" go generate -x ./...\n   ```\n\n4. Build the codebase.\n\n   ```shell\n   go build -trimpath -mod=vendor\n   ```\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache-2 License](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/LICENSE).\n"

Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.\n\nStart broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.\n\n* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.\n* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.\n* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.\n\n| | Short | Medium | Long |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Read through the [System design topics](#index-of-system-design-topics) to get a broad understanding of how systems work | :+1: | :+1: | :+1: |\n| Read through a few articles in the [Company engineering blogs](#company-engineering-blogs) for the companies you are interviewing with | :+1: | :+1: | :+1: |\n| Read through a few [Real world architectures](#real-world-architectures) | :+1: | :+1: | :+1: |\n| Review [How to approach a system design interview question](#how-to-approach-a-system-design-interview-question) | :+1: | :+1: | :+1: |\n| Work through [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) | Some | Many | Most |\n| Work through [Object-oriented design interview questions with solutions](#object-oriented-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) | Some | Many | Most |\n| Review [Additional system design interview questions](#additional-system-design-interview-questions) | Some | Many | Most |\n\n## How to approach a system design interview question\n\n> How to tackle a system design interview question.\n\nThe system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.\n\nYou can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.\n\n### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions\n\nGather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.\n\n* Who is going to use it?\n* How are they going to use it?\n* How many users are there?\n* What does the system do?\n* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?\n* How much data do we expect to handle?\n* How many requests per second do we expect?\n* What is the expected read to write ratio?\n\n### Step 2: Create a high level design\n\nOutline a high level design with all important components.\n\n* Sketch the main components and connections\n* Justify your ideas\n\n### Step 3: Design core components\n\nDive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:\n\n* Generating and storing a hash of the full url\n    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)\n    * Hash collisions\n    * SQL or NoSQL\n    * Database schema\n* Translating a hashed url to the full url\n    * Database lookup\n* API and object-oriented design\n\n### Step 4: Scale the design\n\nIdentify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?\n\n* Load balancer\n* Horizontal scaling\n* Caching\n* Database sharding\n\nDiscuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).\n\n### Back-of-the-envelope calculations\n\nYou might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:\n\n* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)\n* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)\n* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\nCheck out the following links to get a better idea of what to expect:\n\n* [How to ace a

how they are used, and their pros and cons.\n\n### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture\n\n[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)\n\n* Topics covered:\n    * Vertical scaling\n    * Horizontal scaling\n    * Caching\n    * Load balancing\n    * Database replication\n    * Database partitioning\n\n### Step 2: Review the scalability article\n\n[Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)\n\n* Topics covered:\n    * [Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)\n    *

**scalability**\n* **Latency** vs **throughput**\n* **Availability** vs **consistency**\n\nKeep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.\n\nThen we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.\n\n## Performance vs scalability\n\nA service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.<sup><a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html>1</a></sup>\n\nAnother way to look at performance vs scalability:\n\n* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.\n* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [A word on scalability](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html)\n* [Scalability, availability, stability, patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)\n\n## Latency vs throughput\n\n**Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.\n\n**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.\n\nGenerally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [Understanding latency vs throughput](https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/sd/archive/2010/09/13/understanding-latency-vs-throughput)\n\n## Availability vs consistency\n\n### CAP theorem\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/bgLMI2u.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited>Source: CAP theorem revisited</a></i>\n</p>\n\nIn a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:\n\n* **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error\n* **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information\n* **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures\n\n*Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.*\n\n#### CP - consistency and partition tolerance\n\nWaiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.\n\n#### AP - availability and partition tolerance\n\nResponses return the most readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.\n\nAP is a good choice if the business needs allow for [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [CAP theorem revisited](http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited/)\n* [A plain english introduction to CAP theorem](http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem)\n* [CAP FAQ](https://github.com/henryr/cap-faq)\n* [The CAP theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Yaq8AHlFA)\n\n## Consistency patterns\n\nWith multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the [CAP theorem](#cap-theorem) - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\n\n### Weak consistency\n\nAfter a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.\n\nThis approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.\n\n### Eventual consistency\n\nAfter a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.\n\nThis approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.\n\n### Strong consistency\n\nAfter a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.\n\nThis approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [Transactions across data centers](http://snarfed.org/transactions_across_datacenters_io.html)\n\n## Availability patterns\n\nThere are two complementary patterns to support high availability: **fail-over** and **replication**.\n\n### Fail-over\n\n#### Active-passive\n\nWith active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.\n\nThe length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.\n\nActive-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.\n\n#### Active-active\n\nIn active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.\n\nIf the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.\n\nActive-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.\n\n### Disadvantage(s): failover\n\n* Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n* There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.\n\n### Replication\n\n#### Master-slave and master-master\n\nThis topic is further discussed in the [Database](#database) section:\n\n* [Master-slave replication](#master-slave-replication)\n* [Master-master replication](#master-master-replication)\n\n### Availability in numbers\n\nAvailability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available.  Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.\n\n#### 99.9% availability - three 9s\n\n| Duration            | Acceptable downtime|\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Downtime per year   | 8h 45min 57s       |\n| Downtime per month  | 43m 49.7s          |\n| Downtime per week   | 10m 4.8s           |\n| Downtime per day    | 1m 26.4s           |\n\n#### 99.99% availability - four 9s\n\n| Duration            | Acceptable downtime|\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Downtime per year   | 52min 35.7s        |\n| Downtime per month  | 4m 23s             |\n| Downtime per week   | 1m 5s              |\n| Downtime per day    | 8.6s               |\n\n#### Availability in parallel vs in sequence\n\nIf a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service's overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.\n\n###### In sequence\n\nOverall availability decreases when two components with availability < 100% are in sequence:\n\n```\nAvailability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)\n```\n\nIf both `Foo` and `Bar` each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.\n\n###### In parallel\n\nOverall availability increases when two components with availability < 100% are in parallel:\n\n```\nAvailability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))\n```\n\nIf both `Foo` and `Bar` each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.\n\n## Domain name system\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/IOyLj4i.jpg\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/srikrupa5/dns-security-presentation-issa>Source: DNS security presentation</a></i>\n</p>\n\nA Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.\n\nDNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the [time to live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live).\n\n* **NS record (name server)** - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.\n* **MX record (mail exchange)** - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.\n* **A record (address)** - Points a name to an IP address.\n* **CNAME (canonical)** - Points a name to another name or `CNAME` (example.com to www.example.com) or to an `A` record.\n\nServices such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) and [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:\n\n* [Weighted round robin](https://www.jscape.com/blog/load-balancing-algorithms)\n    * Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance\n    * Balance between varying cluster sizes\n    * A/B testing\n* [Latency-based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency)\n* [Geolocation-based](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo)\n\n### Disadvantage(s): DNS\n\n* Accessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.\n* DNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by [governments, ISPs, and large companies](http://superuser.com/questions/472695/who-controls-the-dns-servers/472729).\n* DNS services have recently come under [DDoS attack](http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/), preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [DNS architecture](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd197427(v=ws.10).aspx)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)\n* [DNS articles](https://support.dnsimple.com/categories/dns/)\n\n## Content delivery network\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/h9TAuGI.jpg\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://www.creative-artworks.eu/why-use-a-content-delivery-network-cdn/>Source: Why use a CDN</a></i>\n</p>\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.\n\nServing content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:\n\n* Users receive content from data centers close to them\n* Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills\n\n### Push CDNs\n\nPush CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.\n\nSites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.\n\n### Pull CDNs\n\nPull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.\n\nA [time-to-live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.\n\nSites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.\n\n### Disadvantage(s): CDN\n\n* CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.\n* Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.\n* CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [Globally distributed content delivery](https://figshare.com/articles/Globally_distributed_content_delivery/6605972)\n* [The differences between push and pull CDNs](http://www.travelblogadvice.com/technical/the-differences-between-push-and-pull-cdns/)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)\n\n## Load balancer\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/h81n9iK.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://horicky.blogspot.com/2010/10/scalable-system-design-patterns.html>Source: Scalable system design patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\nLoad balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:\n\n* Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers\n* Preventing overloading resources\n* Helping to eliminate a single point of failure\n\nLoad balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.\n\nAdditional benefits include:\n\n* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\n    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server\n* **Session persistence** - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions\n\nTo protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in [active-passive](#active-passive) or [active-active](#active-active) mode.\n\nLoad balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:\n\n* Random\n* Least loaded\n* Session/cookies\n* [Round robin or weighted round robin](https://www.g33kinfo.com/info/round-robin-vs-weighted-round-robin-lb)\n* [Layer 4](#layer-4-load-balancing)\n* [Layer 7](#layer-7-load-balancing)\n\n### Layer 4 load balancing\n\nLayer 4 load balancers look at info at the [transport layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing [Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/).\n\n### Layer 7 load balancing\n\nLayer 7 load balancers look at the [application layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminate network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.\n\nAt the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.\n\n### Horizontal scaling\n\nLoad balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called **Vertical Scaling**.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.\n\n#### Disadvantage(s): horizontal scaling\n\n* Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers\n    * Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures\n    * Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a [database](#database) (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent [cache](#cache) (Redis, Memcached)\n* Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out\n\n### Disadvantage(s): load balancer\n\n* The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.\n* Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate a single point of failure results in increased complexity.\n* A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [NGINX architecture](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/)\n* [HAProxy architecture guide](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.2/doc/architecture.txt)\n* [Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))\n* [Layer 4 load balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/)\n* [Layer 7 load balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-7-load-balancing/)\n* [ELB listener config](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-listener-config.html)\n\n## Reverse proxy (web server)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/n41Azff.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Reverse_proxy_h2g2bob.svg>Source: Wikipedia</a></i>\n  <br/>\n</p>\n\nA reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.\n\nAdditional benefits include:\n\n* **Increased security** - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client\n* **Increased scalability and flexibility** - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration\n* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations\n    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server\n* **Compression** - Compress server responses\n* **Caching** - Return the response for cached requests\n* **Static content** - Serve static content directly\n    * HTML/CSS/JS\n    * Photos\n    * Videos\n    * Etc\n\n### Load balancer vs reverse proxy\n\n* Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.\n* Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.\n* Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.\n\n### Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy\n\n* Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.\n* A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a [failover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover)) further increases complexity.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [Reverse proxy vs load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-vs-load-balancer/)\n* [NGINX architecture](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/)\n* [HAProxy architecture guide](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.2/doc/architecture.txt)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)\n\n## Application layer\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/yB5SYwm.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/#platform_layer>Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale</a></i>\n</p>\n\nSeparating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.  Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.  The **single responsibility principle** advocates for small and autonomous services that work together.  Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.\n\nWorkers in the application layer also help enable [asynchronism](#asynchronism).\n\n### Microservices\n\nRelated to this discussion are [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services.  Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. <sup><a href=https://smartbear.com/learn/api-design/what-are-microservices>1</a></sup>\n\nPinterest, for example, could have the following microservices: user profile, follower, feed, search, photo upload, etc.\n\n### Service Discovery\n\nSystems such as [Consul](https://www.consul.io/docs/index.html), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest), and [Zookeeper](http://www.slideshare.net/sauravhaloi/introduction-to-apache-zookeeper) can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.  [Health checks](https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/checks.html) help verify service integrity and are often done using an [HTTP](#hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) endpoint.  Both Consul and Etcd have a built in [key-value store](#key-value-store) that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.\n\n### Disadvantage(s): application layer\n\n* Adding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural, operations, and process viewpoint (vs a monolithic system).\n* Microservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [Intro to architecting systems for scale](http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale)\n* [Crack the system design interview](http://www.puncsky.com/blog/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview)\n* [Service oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)\n* [Introduction to Zookeeper](http://www.slideshare.net/sauravhaloi/introduction-to-apache-zookeeper)\n* [Here's what you need to know about building microservices](https://cloudncode.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/msa-getting-started/)\n\n## Database\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/Xkm5CXz.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKjm4ehYiMs>Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users</a></i>\n</p>\n\n### Relational database management system (RDBMS)\n\nA relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.\n\n**ACID** is a set of properties of relational database [transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction).\n\n* **Atomicity** - Each transaction is all or nothing\n* **Consistency** - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another\n* **Isolation** - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially\n* **Durability** - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so\n\nThere are many techniques to scale a relational database: **master-slave replication**, **master-master replication**, **federation**, **sharding**, **denormalization**, and **SQL tuning**.\n\n#### Master-slave replication\n\nThe master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads.  Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.  If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/C9ioGtn.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/>Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): master-slave replication\n\n* Additional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.\n* See [Disadvantage(s): replication](#disadvantages-replication) for points related to **both** master-slave and master-master.\n\n#### Master-master replication\n\nBoth masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.  If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/krAHLGg.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/>Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): master-master replication\n\n* You'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.\n* Most master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.\n* Conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.\n* See [Disadvantage(s): replication](#disadvantages-replication) for points related to **both** master-slave and master-master.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): replication\n\n* There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.\n* Writes are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.\n* The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.\n* On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.\n* Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: replication\n\n* [Scalability, availability, stability, patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)\n* [Multi-master replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-master_replication)\n\n#### Federation\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/U3qV33e.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKjm4ehYiMs>Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users</a></i>\n</p>\n\nFederation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: **forums**, **users**, and **products**, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag.  Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality.  With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): federation\n\n* Federation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.\n* You'll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.\n* Joining data from two databases is more complex with a [server link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145637/querying-data-by-joining-two-tables-in-two-database-on-different-servers).\n* Federation adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: federation\n\n* [Scaling up to your first 10 million users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKjm4ehYiMs)\n\n#### Sharding\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/wU8x5Id.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/>Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\nSharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data.  Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.\n\nSimilar to the advantages of [federation](#federation), sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.  Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries.  If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you'll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.  Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.\n\nCommon ways to shard a table of users is either through the user's last name initial or the user's geographic location.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): sharding\n\n* You'll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.\n* Data distribution can become lopsided in a shard.  For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.\n    * Rebalancing adds additional complexity.  A sharding function based on [consistent hashing](http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html) can reduce the amount of transferred data.\n* Joining data from multiple shards is more complex.\n* Sharding adds more hardware and additional complexity.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: sharding\n\n* [The coming of the shard](http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/8/6/an-unorthodox-approach-to-database-design-the-coming-of-the.html)\n* [Shard database architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))\n* [Consistent hashing](http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/12/9/the-magic-of-consistent-hashing.html)\n\n#### Denormalization\n\nDenormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance.  Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.  Some RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) and Oracle support [materialized views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.\n\nOnce data becomes distributed with techniques such as [federation](#federation) and [sharding](#sharding), managing joins across data centers further increases complexity.  Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.\n\nIn most systems, reads can heavily outnumber writes 100:1 or even 1000:1.  A read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive, spending a significant amount of time on disk operations.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): denormalization\n\n* Data is duplicated.\n* Constraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync, which increases complexity of the database design.\n* A denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart.\n\n###### Source(s) and further reading: denormalization\n\n* [Denormalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization)\n\n#### SQL tuning\n\nSQL tuning is a broad topic and many [books](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=sql+tuning) have been written as reference.\n\nIt's important to **benchmark** and **profile** to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.\n\n* **Benchmark** - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as [ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html).\n* **Profile** - Enable tools such as the [slow query log](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) to help track performance issues.\n\nBenchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.\n\n##### Tighten up the schema\n\n* MySQL dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access.\n* Use `CHAR` instead of `VARCHAR` for fixed-length fields.\n    * `CHAR` effectively allows for fast, random access, whereas with `VARCHAR`, you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one.\n* Use `TEXT` for large blocks of text such as blog posts.  `TEXT` also allows for boolean searches.  Using a `TEXT` field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block.\n* Use `INT` for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion.\n* Use `DECIMAL` for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.\n* Avoid storing large `BLOBS`, store the location of where to get the object instead.\n* `VARCHAR(255)` is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number, often maximizing the use of a byte in some RDBMS.\n* Set the `NOT NULL` constraint where applicable to [improve search performance](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017239/how-do-null-values-affect-performance-in-a-database-search).\n\n##### Use good indices\n\n* Columns that you are querying (`SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`) could be faster with indices.\n* Indices are usually represented as self-balancing [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.\n* Placing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.\n* Writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated.\n* When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.\n\n##### Avoid expensive joins\n\n* [Denormalize](#denormalization) where performance demands it.\n\n##### Partition tables\n\n* Break up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory.\n\n##### Tune the query cache\n\n* In some cases, the [query cache](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-cache.html) could lead to [performance issues](https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/10/12/mysql-5-7-performance-tuning-immediately-after-installation/).\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: SQL tuning\n\n* [Tips for optimizing MySQL queries](http://aiddroid.com/10-tips-optimizing-mysql-queries-dont-suck/)\n* [Is there a good reason i see VARCHAR(255) used so often?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1217466/is-there-a-good-reason-i-see-varchar255-used-so-often-as-opposed-to-another-l)\n* [How do null values affect performance?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017239/how-do-null-values-affect-performance-in-a-database-search)\n* [Slow query log](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html)\n\n### NoSQL\n\nNoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a **key-value store**, **document store**, **wide column store**, or a **graph database**.  Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency).\n\n**BASE** is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases.  In comparison with the [CAP Theorem](#cap-theorem), BASE chooses availability over consistency.\n\n* **Basically available** - the system guarantees availability.\n* **Soft state** - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.\n* **Eventual consistency** - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period.\n\nIn addition to choosing between [SQL or NoSQL](#sql-or-nosql), it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s).  We'll review **key-value stores**, **document stores**, **wide column stores**, and **graph databases** in the next section.\n\n#### Key-value store\n\n> Abstraction: hash table\n\nA key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD.  Data stores can maintain keys in [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order), allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.\n\nKey-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer.  Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.\n\nA key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: key-value store\n\n* [Key-value database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database)\n* [Disadvantages of key-value stores](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4056093/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-using-a-key-value-table-over-nullable-columns-or)\n* [Redis architecture](http://qnimate.com/overview-of-redis-architecture/)\n* [Memcached architecture](https://adayinthelifeof.nl/2011/02/06/memcache-internals/)\n\n#### Document store\n\n> Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values\n\nA document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object.  Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  *Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.*\n\nBased on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories.  Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.\n\nSome document stores like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-architecture) and [CouchDB](https://blog.couchdb.org/2016/08/01/couchdb-2-0-architecture/) also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.  [DynamoDB](http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/cs239-w08/decandia07dynamo.pdf) supports both key-values and documents.\n\nDocument stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: document store\n\n* [Document-oriented database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database)\n* [MongoDB architecture](https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-architecture)\n* [CouchDB architecture](https://blog.couchdb.org/2016/08/01/couchdb-2-0-architecture/)\n* [Elasticsearch architecture](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-elasticsearch-from-the-bottom-up)\n\n#### Wide column store\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/n16iOGk.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://blog.grio.com/2015/11/sql-nosql-a-brief-history.html>Source: SQL & NoSQL, a brief history</a></i>\n</p>\n\n> Abstraction: nested map `ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>`\n\nA wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair).  A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table).  Super column families further group column families.  You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row.  Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.\n\nGoogle introduced [Bigtable](http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/cs239-w08/chang06bigtable.pdf) as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source [HBase](https://www.edureka.co/blog/hbase-architecture/) often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and [Cassandra](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archIntro.html) from Facebook.  Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.\n\nWide column stores offer high availability and high scalability.  They are often used for very large data sets.\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: wide column store\n\n* [SQL & NoSQL, a brief history](http://blog.grio.com/2015/11/sql-nosql-a-brief-history.html)\n* [Bigtable architecture](http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/cs239-w08/chang06bigtable.pdf)\n* [HBase architecture](https://www.edureka.co/blog/hbase-architecture/)\n* [Cassandra architecture](http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archIntro.html)\n\n#### Graph database\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/fNcl65g.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GraphDatabase_PropertyGraph.png>Source: Graph database</a></i>\n</p>\n\n> Abstraction: graph\n\nIn a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.  Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.\n\nGraphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.  Many graphs can only be accessed with [REST APIs](#representational-state-transfer-rest).\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: graph\n\n* [Graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)\n* [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)\n* [FlockDB](https://blog.twitter.com/2010/introducing-flockdb)\n\n#### Source(s) and further reading: NoSQL\n\n* [Explanation of base terminology](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3342497/explanation-of-base-terminology)\n* [NoSQL databases a survey and decision guidance](https://medium.com/baqend-blog/nosql-databases-a-survey-and-decision-guidance-ea7823a822d#.wskogqenq)\n* [Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)\n* [Introduction to NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)\n* [NoSQL patterns](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2009/11/nosql-patterns.html)\n\n### SQL or NoSQL\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/wXGqG5f.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=https://www.infoq.com/articles/Transition-RDBMS-NoSQL/>Source: Transitioning from RDBMS to NoSQL</a></i>\n</p>\n\nReasons for **SQL**:\n\n* Structured data\n* Strict schema\n* Relational data\n* Need for complex joins\n* Transactions\n* Clear patterns for scaling\n* More established: developers, community, code, tools, etc\n* Lookups by index are very fast\n\nReasons for **NoSQL**:\n\n* Semi-structured data\n* Dynamic or flexible schema\n* Non-relational data\n* No need for complex joins\n* Store many TB (or PB) of data\n* Very data intensive workload\n* Very high throughput for IOPS\n\nSample data well-suited for NoSQL:\n\n* Rapid ingest of clickstream and log data\n* Leaderboard or scoring data\n* Temporary data, such as a shopping cart\n* Frequently accessed ('hot') tables\n* Metadata/lookup tables\n\n##### Source(s) and further reading: SQL or NoSQL\n\n* [Scaling up to your first 10 million users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKjm4ehYiMs)\n* [SQL vs NoSQL differences](https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-differences/)\n\n## Cache\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/Q6z24La.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://horicky.blogspot.com/2010/10/scalable-system-design-patterns.html>Source: Scalable system design patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\nCaching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases.  In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.\n\nDatabases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions.  Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks.  Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.\n\n### Client caching\n\nCaches can be located on the client side (OS or browser), [server side](#reverse-proxy-web-server), or in a distinct cache layer.\n\n### CDN caching\n\n[CDNs](#content-delivery-network) are considered a type of cache.\n\n### Web server caching\n\n[Reverse proxies](#reverse-proxy-web-server) and caches such as [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) can serve static and dynamic content directly.  Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.\n\n### Database caching\n\nYour database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case.  Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.\n\n### Application caching\n\nIn-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage.  Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk.  RAM is more limited than disk, so [cache invalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms) algorithms such as [least recently used (LRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM.\n\nRedis has the following additional features:\n\n* Persistence option\n* Built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists\n\nThere are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: **database queries** and **objects**:\n\n* Row level\n* Query-level\n* Fully-formed serializable objects\n* Fully-rendered HTML\n\nGenerally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.\n\n### Caching at the database query level\n\nWhenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache.  This approach suffers from expiration issues:\n\n* Hard to delete a cached result with complex queries\n* If one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell\n\n### Caching at the object level\n\nSee your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code.  Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):\n\n* Remove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed\n* Allows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object\n\nSuggestions of what to cache:\n\n* User sessions\n* Fully rendered web pages\n* Activity streams\n* User graph data\n\n### When to update the cache\n\nSince you can only store a limited amount of data in cache, you'll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case.\n\n#### Cache-aside\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/ONjORqk.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/tmatyashovsky/from-cache-to-in-memory-data-grid-introduction-to-hazelcast>Source: From cache to in-memory data grid</a></i>\n</p>\n\nThe application is responsible for reading and writing from storage.  The cache does not interact with storage directly.  The application does the following:\n\n* Look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss\n* Load entry from the database\n* Add entry to cache\n* Return entry\n\n```python\ndef get_user(self, user_id):\n    user = cache.get(\"user.{0}\", user_id)\n    if user is None:\n        user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}\", user_id)\n        if user is not None:\n            key = \"user.{0}\".format(user_id)\n            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))\n    return user\n```\n\n[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is generally used in this manner.\n\nSubsequent reads of data added to cache are fast.  Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading.  Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): cache-aside\n\n* Each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.\n* Data can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.\n* When a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.\n\n#### Write-through\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/0vBc0hN.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/>Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\nThe application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:\n\n* Application adds/updates entry in cache\n* Cache synchronously writes entry to data store\n* Return\n\nApplication code:\n\n```python\nset_user(12345, {\"foo\":\"bar\"})\n```\n\nCache code:\n\n```python\ndef set_user(user_id, values):\n    user = db.query(\"UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}\", user_id, values)\n    cache.set(user_id, user)\n```\n\nWrite-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast.  Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data.  Data in the cache is not stale.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): write through\n\n* When a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database.  Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.\n* Most data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL.\n\n#### Write-behind (write-back)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/rgSrvjG.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/>Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns</a></i>\n</p>\n\nIn write-behind, the application does the following:\n\n* Add/update entry in cache\n* Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): write-behind\n\n* There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.\n* It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.\n\n#### Refresh-ahead\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/kxtjqgE.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.slideshare.net/tmatyashovsky/from-cache-to-in-memory-data-grid-introduction-to-hazelcast>Source: From cache to in-memory data grid</a></i>\n</p>\n\nYou can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.\n\nRefresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.\n\n##### Disadvantage(s): refresh-ahead\n\n* Not accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh-ahead.\n\n### Disadvantage(s): cache\n\n* Need to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through [cache invalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms).\n* Cache invalidation is a difficult problem, there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache.\n* Need to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [From cache to in-memory data grid](http://www.slideshare.net/tmatyashovsky/from-cache-to-in-memory-data-grid-introduction-to-hazelcast)\n* [Scalable system design patterns](http://horicky.blogspot.com/2010/10/scalable-system-design-patterns.html)\n* [Introduction to architecting systems for scale](http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/)\n* [Scalability, availability, stability, patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)\n* [Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)\n* [AWS ElastiCache strategies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/Strategies.html)\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing))\n\n## Asynchronism\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/54GYsSx.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/#platform_layer>Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale</a></i>\n</p>\n\nAsynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line.  They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.\n\n### Message queues\n\nMessage queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.  If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:\n\n* An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status\n* A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete\n\nThe user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background.  During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed.  For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.\n\n**[Redis](https://redis.io/)** is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.\n\n**[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)** is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes.\n\n**[Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)** is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.\n\n### Task queues\n\nTasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results.  They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.\n\n**[Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/)** has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.\n\n### Back pressure\n\nIf queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance.  [Back pressure](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/05/apply-back-pressure-when-overloaded.html) can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue.  Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later.  Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).\n\n### Disadvantage(s): asynchronism\n\n* Use cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations, as introducing queues can add delays and complexity.\n\n### Source(s) and further reading\n\n* [It's all a numbers game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KRYH75wgy4)\n* [Applying back pressure when overloaded](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/05/apply-back-pressure-when-overloaded.html)\n* [Little's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law)\n* [What is the difference between a message queue and a task queue?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-message-queue-and-a-task-queue-Why-would-a-task-queue-require-a-message-broker-like-RabbitMQ-Redis-Celery-or-IronMQ-to-function)\n\n## Communication\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/5KeocQs.jpg\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.escotal.com/osilayer.html>Source: OSI 7 layer model</a></i>\n</p>\n\n### Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)\n\nHTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.\n\nA basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:\n\n| Verb | Description | Idempotent* | Safe | Cacheable |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| GET | Reads a resource | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| POST | Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\n| PUT | Creates or replace a resource | Yes | No | No |\n| PATCH | Partially updates a resource | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |\n| DELETE | Deletes a resource | Yes | No | No |\n\n*Can be called many times without different outcomes.\n\nHTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as **TCP** and **UDP**.\n\n#### Source(s) and further reading: HTTP\n\n* [What is HTTP?](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/http/)\n* [Difference between HTTP and TCP](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-HTTP-protocol-and-TCP-protocol)\n* [Difference between PUT and PATCH](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/general-discussion/whats-the-differences-between-put-and-patch?page=1)\n\n### Transmission control protocol (TCP)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/JdAsdvG.jpg\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2012/10/09/how-to-make-a-multi-player-game-part-1/>Source: How to make a multiplayer game</a></i>\n</p>\n\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an [IP network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol).

TCP also implements [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)) and [congestion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion#Congestion_control).  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.\n\nTo ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a [memcached](https://memcached.org/) server.  [Connection pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool) can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.\n\nTCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.\n\nUse TCP over UDP when:\n\n* You need all of the data to arrive intact\n* You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput\n\n### User datagram protocol (UDP)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/yzDrJtA.jpg\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2012/10/09/how-to-make-a-multi-player-game-part-1/>Source: How to make a multiplayer game</a></i>\n</p>\n\nUDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.\n\nUDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.\n\nUDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.\n\nUse UDP over TCP when:\n\n* You need the lowest latency\n* Late data is worse than loss of data\n* You want to implement your own error correction\n\n#### Source(s) and further reading: TCP and UDP\n\n* [Networking for game programming](http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/udp-vs-tcp/)\n* [Key differences between TCP and UDP protocols](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/key-differences-between-tcp-and-udp-protocols/)\n* [Difference between TCP and UDP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5970383/difference-between-tcp-and-udp)\n* [Transmission control protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)\n* [User datagram protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)\n* [Scaling memcache at Facebook](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/jappavoo.github.com/451/papers/memcache-fb.pdf)\n\n### Remote procedure call (RPC)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/iF4Mkb5.png\">\n  <br/>\n  <i><a href=http://www.puncsky.com/blog/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview>Source: Crack the system design interview</a></i>\n</p>\n\nIn an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/).\n\nRPC is a request-response protocol:\n\n* **Client program** - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.\n* **Client stub procedure** - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.\n* **Client communication module** - OS sends the message from the client to the server.\n* **Server communication module** - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.\n* **Server stub procedure** -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.\n* The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.\n\nSample RPC calls:\n\n```\nGET /someoperation?data=anId\n\nPOST /anotheroperation\n{\n  \"data\":\"anId\";\n  \"anotherdata\": \"another value\"\n}\n```\n\nRPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.\n\nChoose a native library (aka SDK) when:\n\n* You know your target platform.\n* You want to control how your \"logic\" is accessed.\n* You want to control how error control happens off your library.\n* Performance and end user experience is your primary concern.\n\nHTTP APIs following **REST** tend to be used more often for public APIs.\n\n#### Disadvantage(s): RPC\n\n* RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.\n* A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.\n* It can be difficult to debug RPC.\n* You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure [RPC calls are properly cached](http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/) on caching servers such as [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).\n\n### Representational state transfer (REST)\n\nREST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.\n\nThere are four qualities of a RESTful interface:\n\n* **Identify resources (URI in HTTP)** - use the same URI regardless of any operation.\n* **Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP)** - use verbs, headers, and body.\n* **Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP)** - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.\n* **[HATEOAS](http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/) (HTML interface for HTTP)** - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.\n\nSample REST calls:\n\n```\nGET /someresources/anId\n\nPUT /someresources/anId\n{\"anotherdata\": \"another value\"}\n```\n\nREST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, [representation through headers](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/headers.md), and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.\n\n#### Disadvantage(s): REST\n\n* With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.\n* REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.\n* Fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.\n* Over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.\n\n### RPC and REST calls comparison\n\n| Operation | RPC | REST |\n|---|---|---|\n| Signup    | **POST** /signup | **POST** /persons |\n| Resign    | **POST** /resign<br/>{<br/>\"personid\": \"1234\"<br/>} | **DELETE** /persons/1234 |\n| Read a person | **GET** /readPerson?personid=1234 | **GET** /persons/1234 |\n| Read a person’s items list | **GET** /readUsersItemsList?personid=1234 | **GET** /persons/1234/items |\n| Add an item to a person’s items | **POST** /addItemToUsersItemsList<br/>{<br/>\"personid\": \"1234\";<br/>\"itemid\": \"456\"<br/>} | **POST** /persons/1234/items<br/>{<br/>\"itemid\": \"456\"<br/>} |\n| Update an item    | **POST** /modifyItem<br/>{<br/>\"itemid\": \"456\";<br/>\"key\": \"value\"<br/>} | **PUT** /items/456<br/>{<br/>\"key\": \"value\"<br/>} |\n| Delete an item | **POST** /removeItem<br/>{<br/>\"itemid\": \"456\"<br/>} | **DELETE** /items/456 |\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <i><a href=https://apihandyman.io/do-you-really-know-why-you-prefer-rest-over-rpc/>Source: Do you really know why you prefer REST over RPC</a></i>\n</p>\n\n#### Source(s) and further reading: REST and RPC\n\n* [Do you really know why you prefer REST over RPC](https://apihandyman.io/do-you-really-know-why-you-prefer-rest-over-rpc/)\n* [When are RPC-ish approaches more appropriate than REST?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/181186)\n* [REST vs JSON-RPC](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056878/rest-vs-json-rpc)\n* [Debunking the myths of RPC and REST](http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/)\n* [What are the drawbacks of using REST](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-drawbacks-of-using-RESTful-APIs)\n* [Crack the system design interview](http://www.puncsky.com/blog/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview)\n* [Thrift](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1468950976659943/)\n* [Why REST for internal use and not RPC](http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?t=1190508)\n\n## Security\n\nThis section could use some updates.

Currently this gem assumes that you use the old [`transactionReceipt`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/StoreKit/Reference/SKPaymentTransaction_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/SKPaymentTransaction/transactionReceipt)\nwhich is returned per transaction. The `transactionReceipt` is a base64 encoded binary blob which you should send to your\nserver for the validation process.\n\nTo validate a receipt one normally has to choose between the two different endpoints \"production\" and \"sandbox\" which are provided from\n[Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH104-SW1).\nDuring development your app gets receipts from the sandbox while when released from the production system. A special case is the\nreview process because the review team uses the release version of your app but processes payment against the sandbox.\nOnly for receipts that contain auto-renewable subscriptions you need your app's shared secret (a hexadecimal string),\n\nPlease keep in mind that you have to use test user account from the iTunes connect portal to test in-app purchases during\nyour app's development.\n\n### PlayStore\n\nGoogle's PlayStore has different kind of server-to-server API to check purchases and requires that you register a so\ncalled \"[service account](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount)\". You have to register a\nnew account by yourself, export the generated certificate file and grant the correct permissions to the account for\nyour app using the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).\n\nIf you have set up the Android app correctly you should get a [`purchaseToken`](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference.html#getBuyIntent) per purchased item. You should use this string in combination with `packageName` and `productId` to verify the purchase.\n\n## Usage\n\n### AppStore\n\nFirst you should initialize a verifier instance for your application:\n\n```ruby\nconfig = CandyCheck::AppStore::Config.new(\n  environment: :production # or :sandbox\n)\nverifier = CandyCheck::AppStore::Verifier.new(config)\n```\n\nFor the AppStore the client should deliver a base64 encoded receipt data string\nwhich can be verified by using the following call:\n\n```ruby\nverifier.verify(your_receipt_data) # => Receipt or VerificationFailure\n# or by using a shared secret for subscriptions\nverifier.verify(your_receipt_data, your_secret)\n```\n\nPlease see the class documenations [`CandyCheck::AppStore::Receipt`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/AppStore/Receipt) and [`CandyCheck::AppStore::VerificationFailure`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/AppStore/VerificationFailure) for further details about the responses.\n\nFor **subscription verification**, Apple also returns a list of the user's purchases. Essentially, this is a collection of receipts. To verify a subscription, do the following:\n\n```ruby\n# ... create your verifier as above\nverifier.verify_subscription(your_receipt_data, your_secret) # => ReceiptCollection or VerificationFailure\n```\n\nIf you want to restrict the subscription verification to some specific products, pass their ids as an array:\n\n```ruby\n# ... create your verifier as above\nproduct_ids = ['sk_product_id_1', 'sk_product_id_2'...]\nverifier.verify_subscription(your_receipt_data, your_secret, product_ids) # => ReceiptCollection or VerificationFailure\n```\n\nPlease see the class documentation for [`CandyCheck::AppStore::ReceiptCollection`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/AppStore/ReceiptCollection) for further details.\n\n### PlayStore\n\n> :warning: Version `0.2.0` of `CandyCheck` introduced some breaking changes to the PlayStore functionality to adapt to changes in the Google API. If you're upgrading from a `CandyCheck` version `< 0.2.0` see the [migration guide](/MIGRATION_GUIDE_0_2_0.md) for more.\n\n#### Authorization\n\n##### Getting the JSON Key File\n\nFirst we have to get a `.json` key file, that gives access to the Google API.\n\nThis `.json` key file can be generated under the following URL (make sure to adapt the `project=my-project-name` parameter accordingly):\n\n[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?project=my-project-name](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?project=my-project-name)\n\n##### Building an Authorization Object\n\nWith the `.json` key file downloaded, we can build an authorization object:\n\n```ruby\nauthorization = CandyCheck::PlayStore.authorization(\"/path/to/key.json\")\n```\n\n> **Note:** `CandyCheck` provides the `CandyCheck::PlayStore.authorization` method as convenience to build an authorization object. In case you need more control over your authorization object, refer to the [`google-auth-library-ruby`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-ruby) docs, which describes building authorization objects in detail.\n\n##### Building a verifier\n\nWith the `authorization` object in place, we can build a verifier:\n\n```ruby\nverifier = CandyCheck::PlayStore::Verifier.new(authorization: authorization)\n```\n\n> **Note:** If you need to verify against multiple Google Service Accounts, just instantiate a new verifier with another authorization object that got build with a different `.json` key file.\n\n#### Verifying product purchases\n\nThis `verifier` can be used to verify product purchases in the PlayStore, all you need to do is to pass the `package_name`, `product_id` and `token` of the product purchase you want to verify:\n\n```ruby\nresult = verifier.verify_product_purchase(\n  package_name: \"my-package-name\",\n  product_id: \"my product id\",\n  token: \"my token\"\n)\n# => ProductPurchase or VerificationFailure\n```\n\nOn success this will return an instance of `CandyCheck::Playstore::ProductPurchases::ProductPurchase`, which is a wrapper for the raw [google-api-ruby-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client) data, but additionally provides some handy convenience methods.\nPlease see the class documentations [`CandyCheck::PlayStore::ProductPurchases::ProductPurchase`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/PlayStore/ProductPurchases/ProductPurchase) and [`CandyCheck::PlayStore::VerificationFailure`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/PlayStore/VerificationFailure) for further details about the responses.\n\n#### Verifying subscriptions\n\nIn order to **verify a subscription** from the Play Store, do the following:\n\n```ruby\nresult = verifier.verify_subscription_purchase(\n  package_name: \"my-package-name\",\n  subscription_id: \"my-subscription-id\",\n  token: \"my-token\"\n)\n# => SubscriptionPurchase or VerificationFailure\n```\n\nPlease see documenation for [`CandyCheck::PlayStore::SubscriptionPurchases::SubscriptionPurchase`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnbt/candy_check/master/CandyCheck/PlayStore/SubscriptionPurchases/SubscriptionPurchase) for further details.\n\n\n##### Building an acknowledger\n\nWith the `authorization` object in place, we can build an acknowledger:\n\n```ruby\nacknowledger = CandyCheck::PlayStore::Acknowledger.new(authorization: authorization)\n```\n\n> **Note:** If you need to acknowledge against multiple Google Service Accounts, just instantiate a new acknowledger with another authorization object that got build with a different `.json` key file.\n\n#### Acknowledging the purchase\nGoogle Play purchases if not acknowledged are automatically refunded. The acknowledgement can be done client-side or server-side. If server-side validation is being used we recommend to proceed with the acknowledgement afterwards, since it is the only save way to ensure the users received what they have paid for.\n\n```ruby\nresult = acknowledger.acknowledge_product_purchase(\n  package_name: \"my-package-name\",\n  product_id: \"my-subscription-id\",\n  token: \"my-token\"\n)\n# => ProductAcknowledgements::Response\n```\n\nThe acknowledger response has 2 methods:\n\n- `#acknowledged?` returns a boolean. It returns true only if it has been acknowledged at this moment (that's Google Play behaviour).\n- `#error` returns a hash with `status_code` and `body` keys.\n\n## CLI\n\nThis gem ships with an executable to verify in-app purchases directly from your terminal:\n\n### AppStore\n\nYou only need to specify the base64 encoded receipt:\n\n```bash\n$ candy_check app_store RECEIPT_DATA\n```\n\nSee all options:\n\n```bash\n$ candy_check help app_store\n```\n\n### PlayStore\n\nFor the PlayStore you need to specify at least the issuer, the key file, your package name, the product and the actual\npurchase token:\n\n```bash\n$ candy_check play_store PACKAGE_NAME PRODUCT_ID TOKEN --json-key-file=/path/to/key.json\n```\n\nSee all options:\n\n```bash\n$ candy_check help play_store\n```\n\n\n## Todos\n\n* Allow using the combined StoreKit receipt data\n* Find a ways to run integration tests\n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nPlease submit them here https://github.com/jnbt/candy_check/issues\n\n## Test\n\nSimple run\n\n```Bash\nrake\n```\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2016 Jonas Thiel.

The push notification service for Ruby.\n\nRpush aims to be the *de facto* gem for sending push notifications in Ruby. Its core goals are ease of use, reliability and a rich feature set. Rpush provides numerous advanced features not found in others gems, giving you greater control & insight as your project grows. These are a few of the reasons why companies worldwide rely on Rpush to deliver their notifications.\n\n#### Supported Services\n\n  * [**Apple Push Notification Service**](#apple-push-notification-service)\n    * Including Safari Push Notifications.\n  * [**Firebase Cloud Messaging**](#firebase-cloud-messaging) (used to be Google Cloud Messaging)\n  * [**Amazon Device Messaging**](#amazon-device-messaging)\n  * [**Windows Phone Push Notification Service**](#windows-phone-notification-service)\n  * [**Pushy**](#pushy)\n  * [**Webpush**](#webpush)\n\n#### Feature Highlights\n\n* Use [**ActiveRecord**](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-ActiveRecord) or [**Redis**](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-Redis) for storage.\n* Plugins for [**Bugsnag**](https://github.com/rpush/rpush-plugin-bugsnag),\n[**Sentry**](https://github.com/rpush/rpush-plugin-sentry), [**StatsD**](https://github.com/rpush/rpush-plugin-statsd). Third party plugins: [**Prometheus Exporter**](https://github.com/equinux/rpush-plugin-prometheus-exporter). Or [write your own](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Writing-a-Plugin).\n* Seamless integration with your projects, including **Rails**.\n* Run as a [daemon](https://github.com/rpush/rpush#as-a-daemon), inside a [job queue](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Push-API), on the [command-line](https://github.com/rpush/rpush#on-the-command-line) or [embedded](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Embedding-API) in another process.\n* Scales vertically (threading) and horizontally (multiple processes).\n* Designed for uptime - new apps are loaded automatically, signal `HUP` to update running apps.\n* Hooks for fine-grained instrumentation and error handling ([Reflection API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Reflection-API)).\n* Tested with **MRI**\n\n\n### Getting Started\n\nAdd it to your Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'rpush'\n```\n\nInitialize Rpush into your project. **Rails will be detected automatically.**\n\n```sh\n$ cd /path/to/project\n$ bundle\n$ bundle exec rpush init\n```\n\n### Create an App & Notification\n\n#### Apple Push Notification Service\n\nThere is a choice of two modes (and one legacy mode) using certificates or using tokens:\n\n* `Rpush::Apns2` This requires an annually renewable certificate. see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns\n* `Rpush::Apnsp8` This uses encrypted tokens and requires an encryption key id and encryption key (provide as a p8 file). (see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns)\n* `Rpush::Apns` There is also the original APNS (the original version using certificates with a binary underlying protocol over TCP directly rather than over Http/2).\n  Apple have [announced](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=c88acm2b) that this is not supported after March 31, 2021.\n\nIf this is your first time using the APNs, you will need to generate either SSL certificates (for Apns2 or Apns) or an Encryption Key (p8) and an Encryption Key ID (for Apnsp8). See [Generating Certificates](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Generating-Certificates) for instructions.\n\n##### Apnsp8\n\nTo use the p8 APNs Api:\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Apnsp8::App.new\napp.name = \"ios_app\"\napp.apn_key = File.read(\"/path/to/sandbox.p8\")\napp.environment = \"development\" # APNs environment.\napp.apn_key_id = \"APN KEY ID\" # This is the Encryption Key ID provided by apple\napp.team_id = \"TEAM ID\" # the team id - e.g. ABCDE12345\napp.bundle_id = \"BUNDLE ID\" # the unique bundle id of the app, like com.example.appname\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Apnsp8::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Apnsp8::App.find_by_name(\"ios_app\")\nn.device_token = \"...\" # hex string\nn.alert = \"hi mom!\"\nn.data = { foo: :bar }\nn.save!\n```\n\n##### Apns2\n\n(NB this uses the same protocol as Apnsp8, but authenticates with a certificate rather than tokens)\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Apns2::App.new\napp.name = \"ios_app\"\napp.certificate = File.read(\"/path/to/sandbox.pem\")\napp.environment = \"development\"\napp.password = \"certificate password\"\napp.bundle_id = \"BUNDLE ID\" # the unique bundle id of the app, like com.example.appname\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Apns2::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Apns2::App.find_by_name(\"ios_app\")\nn.device_token = \"...\" # hex string\nn.alert = \"hi mom!\"\nn.data = {\n  headers: { 'apns-topic': \"BUNDLE ID\" }, # the bundle id of the app, like com.example.appname. Not necessary if set on the app (see above)\n  foo: :bar\n}\nn.save!\n```\n\nYou should also implement the [ssl_certificate_will_expire](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Reflection-API) reflection to monitor when your certificate is due to expire.\n\n##### Apns (legacy protocol)\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Apns::App.new\napp.name = \"ios_app\"\napp.certificate = File.read(\"/path/to/sandbox.pem\")\napp.environment = \"development\" # APNs environment.\napp.password = \"certificate password\"\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Apns::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Apns::App.find_by_name(\"ios_app\")\nn.device_token = \"...\" # hex string\nn.alert = \"hi mom!\"\nn.data = { foo: :bar }\nn.save!\n```\n\n##### Safari Push Notifications\n\nUsing one of the notifications methods above, the `url_args` attribute is available for Safari Push Notifications.\n\n##### Environment\n\nThe app `environment` for any Apns* option is \"development\" for XCode installs, and \"production\" for app store and TestFlight. Note that for Apns2 you can now use one (production + sandbox) certificate (you don't need a separate \"sandbox\" or development certificate), but if you do generate a development/sandbox certificate it can only be used for \"development\". With Apnsp8 tokens, you can target either \"development\" or \"production\" environments.\n\n#### Firebase Cloud Messaging\n\nFCM and GCM are – as of writing – compatible with each other. See also [this comment](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/issues/284#issuecomment-228330206) for further references.\n\nPlease refer to the Firebase Console on where to find your `auth_key` (probably called _Server Key_ there). To verify you have the right key, use tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/), `curl` or similar before reporting a new issue. See also [this comment](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/issues/346#issuecomment-289218776).\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Gcm::App.new\napp.name = \"android_app\"\napp.auth_key = \"...\"\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Gcm::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Gcm::App.find_by_name(\"android_app\")\nn.registration_ids = [\"...\"]\nn.data = { message: \"hi mom!\" }\nn.priority = 'high'        # Optional, can be either 'normal' or 'high'\nn.content_available = true # Optional\n# Optional notification payload. See the reference below for more keys you can use!\nn.notification = { body: 'great match!',\n                   title: 'Portugal vs. Denmark',\n                   icon: 'myicon'\n                 }\nn.save!\n```\n\nFCM also requires you to respond to [Canonical IDs](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Canonical-IDs).\n\nCheck the [FCM reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref#notification-payload-support) for what keys you can use and are available to you. **Note:** Not all are yet implemented in Rpush.\n\n#### Amazon Device Messaging\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Adm::App.new\napp.name = \"kindle_app\"\napp.client_id = \"...\"\napp.client_secret = \"...\"\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Adm::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Adm::App.find_by_name(\"kindle_app\")\nn.registration_ids = [\"...\"]\nn.data = { message: \"hi mom!\"}\nn.collapse_key = \"Optional consolidationKey\"\nn.save!\n```\n\nFor more documentation on [ADM](https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm.html).\n\n#### Windows Phone Notification Service (Windows Phone 8.0 and 7.x)\n\nUses the older [Windows Phone 8 Toast template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj662938(v=vs.105).aspx)\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Wpns::App.new\napp.name = \"windows_phone_app\"\napp.client_id = # Get this from your apps dashboard https://dev.windows.com\napp.client_secret = # Get this from your apps dashboard https://dev.windows.com\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Wpns::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Wpns::App.find_by_name(\"windows_phone_app\")\nn.uri = \"http://...\"\nn.data = {title:\"MyApp\", body:\"Hello world\", param:\"user_param1\"}\nn.save!\n```\n\n#### Windows Notification Service (Windows 8.1, 10 Apps & Phone > 8.0)\n\nUses the more recent [Toast template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt631604.aspx)\n\nThe `client_id` here is the SID URL as seen [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465407.aspx#7-SIDandSecret). Do not confuse it with the `client_id` on dashboard.\n\nYou can (optionally) include a launch argument by adding a `launch` key to the notification data.\n\nYou can (optionally) include an [audio element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/br230842.aspx) by setting the sound on the notification.\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Wns::App.new\napp.name = \"windows_phone_app\"\napp.client_id = YOUR_SID_URL\napp.client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Wns::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Wns::App.find_by_name(\"windows_phone_app\")\nn.uri = \"http://...\"\nn.data = {title:\"MyApp\", body:\"Hello world\", launch:\"launch-argument\"}\nn.sound = \"ms-appx:///mynotificationsound.wav\"\nn.save!\n```\n\n#### Windows Raw Push Notifications\n\nNote: The data is passed as `.to_json` so only this format is supported, although raw notifications are meant to support any kind of data.\nCurrent data structure enforces hashes and `.to_json` representation is natural presentation of it.\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Wns::RawNotification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Wns::App.find_by_name(\"windows_phone_app\")\nn.uri = 'http://...'\nn.data = { foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' }\nn.save!\n```\n\n#### Windows Badge Push Notifications\n\nUses the [badge template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/br212849.aspx) and the type `wns/badge`.\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Wns::BadgeNotification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Wns::App.find_by_name(\"windows_phone_app\")\nn.uri = 'http://...'\nn.badge = 4\nn.save!\n```\n\n#### Pushy\n\n[Pushy](https://pushy.me/) is a highly-reliable push notification gateway, based on [MQTT](https://pushy.me/support#what-is-mqtt) protocol for cross platform push notification delivery that includes web, Android, and iOS. One of its advantages is it allows for reliable notification delivery to Android devices in China where Google Cloud Messaging and Firebase Cloud Messaging are blocked and to custom hardware devices that use Android OS but are not using Google Play Services.\n\nNote: current implementation of Pushy only supports Android devices and does not include [subscriptions](https://pushy.me/docs/android/subscribe-topics).\n\n```ruby\napp = Rpush::Pushy::App.new\napp.name = \"android_app\"\napp.api_key = YOUR_API_KEY\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Pushy::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::Pushy::App.find_by_name(\"android_app\")\nn.registration_ids = [\"...\"]\nn.data = { message: \"hi mom!\"}\nn.time_to_live = 60 # seconds\nn.save!\n```\n\nFor more documentation on [Pushy](https://pushy.me/docs).\n\n#### Webpush\n\n[Webpush](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-10) is a\nprotocol for delivering push messages to desktop browsers. It's supported by\nall major browsers (except Safari, you have to use one of the Apns transports\nfor that).\n\nUsing [VAPID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-vapid-01), there\nis no need for the sender of push notifications to register upfront with push\nservices (as was the case with the now legacy Mozilla or Google desktop push\nproviders).\n\nInstead, you generate a pair of keys and use the public key when subscribing\nusers in your web app. The keys are stored along with an email address (which,\naccording to the spec, can be used by push service providers to contact you in\ncase of problems) in the `certificates` field of the Rpush Application record:\n\n```ruby\nvapid_keypair = Webpush.generate_key.to_hash\napp = Rpush::Webpush::App.new\napp.name = 'webpush'\napp.certificate = vapid_keypair.merge(subject: 'user@example.org').to_json\napp.connections = 1\napp.save!\n```\n\nThe `subscription` object you obtain from a subscribed browser holds an\nendpoint URL and cryptographic keys. When sending a notification, simply pass\nthe whole subscription as sole member of the `registration_ids` collection:\n\n```ruby\nn = Rpush::Webpush::Notification.new\nn.app = Rpush::App.find_by_name(\"webpush\")\nn.registration_ids = [subscription]\nn.data = { message: \"hi mom!\" }\nn.save!\n```\n\nIn order to send the same message to multiple devices, create one\n`Notification` per device, as passing multiple subscriptions at once as\n`registration_ids` is not supported.\n\n\n### Running Rpush\n\nIt is recommended to run Rpush as a separate process in most cases, though embedding and manual modes are provided for low-workload environments.\n\nSee `rpush help` for all available commands and options.\n\n#### As a daemon\n\n```sh\n$ cd /path/to/project\n$ rpush start\n```\n\n#### As a foreground process\n\n```sh\n$ cd /path/to/project\n$ rpush start -f\n```\n\n#### On the command-line\n\n```sh\n$ rpush push\n```\n\nRpush will deliver all pending notifications and then exit.\n\n#### In a scheduled job\n\n```ruby\nRpush.push\nRpush.apns_feedback\n```\n\nSee [Push API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Push-API) for more details.\n\n#### Embedded inside an existing process\n\n```ruby\nif defined?(Rails)\n  ActiveSupport.on_load(:after_initialize) do\n    Rpush.embed\n  end\nelse\n  Rpush.embed\nend\n```\n\nCall this during startup of your application, for example, by adding it to the end of `config/rpush.rb`. See [Embedding API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Embedding-API) for more details.\n\n#### Using mina\n\nIf you're using [mina](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina), there is a gem called [mina-rpush](https://github.com/d4rky-pl/mina-rpush) which helps you control rpush.\n\n### Cleanup\n\nRpush leaves delivered notifications in the database. If you do not clear them out, they will take up more and more space. This isn't great for any database, but is especially problematic if using Redis as the Rpush store. [Here](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-Redis) is an example solution for cleaning up delivered notifications in Redis.\n\n### Configuration\n\nSee [Configuration](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Configuration) for a list of options.\n\n### Updating Rpush\n\nYou should run `rpush init` after upgrading Rpush to check for configuration and migration changes.\n\n### From The Wiki\n\n### General\n* [Using Redis](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-Redis)\n* [Using ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-ActiveRecord)\n* [Configuration](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Configuration)\n* [Moving from Rapns](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Moving-from-Rapns-to-Rpush)\n* [Deploying to Heroku](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Heroku)\n* [Hot App Updates](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Hot-App-Updates)\n* [Signals](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Signals)\n* [Reflection API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Reflection-API)\n* [Push API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Push-API)\n* [Embedding API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Embedding-API)\n* [Writing a Plugin](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Writing-a-Plugin)\n* [Implementing your own storage backend](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Implementing-your-own-storage-backend)\n* [Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Upgrading-from-version-2.x-to-3.0)\n\n### Apple Push Notification Service\n* [Generating Certificates](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Generating-Certificates)\n* [Advanced APNs Features](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Advanced-APNs-Features)\n* [APNs Delivery Failure Handling](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/APNs-Delivery-Failure-Handling)\n* [Why open multiple connections to the APNs?](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Why-open-multiple-connections-to-the-APNs%3F)\n* [Silent failures might be dropped connections](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Dropped-connections)\n\n### Firebase Cloud Messaging\n* [Notification Options](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/GCM-Notification-Options)\n* [Canonical IDs](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Canonical-IDs)\n* [Delivery Failures & Retries](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Delivery-Failures-&-Retries)\n\n### Contributing\n\n#### Running Tests\n\nRpush uses [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to run tests against multiple versions of Ruby on Rails. This helps making sure that Rpush performs correctly with multiple Rails versions.\n\nRpush also uses RSpec for its tests.\n\n##### Bootstrapping your test suite:\n\nFirst, we need to setup a test database, `rpush_test`.\n\nE.g. (postgres): `psql -c 'create database rpush_test;' -U postgres >/dev/null`\n\n```\nbundle install\nbundle exec appraisal install\n```\nThis will install all the required gems that requires to test against each version of Rails, which defined in `gemfiles/*.gemfile`.\n\n##### To run a full test suite:\n\n```\nbundle exec appraisal rake\n```\nThis will run RSpec against all versions of Rails.\n\n##### To run a single test\n\nYou need to specify a `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` pointing to the gemfile before running the normal test command:\n\n```\nBUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails_5.2.gemfile rspec spec/unit/apns_feedback_spec.rb\n```\n\n##### Multiple database adapter support\n\nWhen running specs, please note that the ActiveRecord adapter can be changed by setting the `ADAPTER` environment variable. For example: `ADAPTER=postgresql rake`.\n\nAvailable adapters for testing are `postgresql`, `jdbcpostgresql`, `mysql2`, `jdbcmysql`, `jdbch2`, and `sqlite3`.\n\nNote that the database username is changed at runtime to be the currently logged in user's name. So if you're testing\nwith mysql and you're using a user named 'bob', you will need to grant a mysql user 'bob' access to the 'rpush_test'\nmysql database.\n\nTo switch between ActiveRecord and Redis, set the `CLIENT` environment variable to either `active_record` or `redis`.\n"

    "text" : "# A File Opener Plugin for Cordova\r\n\r\n[![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cordova-plugin-file-opener2.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-file-opener2) [![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/cordova-plugin-file-opener2.svg)](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=cordova-plugin-file-opener2)\r\n\r\nThis plugin will open a file on your device file system with its default application.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.open(\r\n    filePath,\r\n    fileMIMEType,\r\n    {\r\n        error : function(){ },\r\n        success : function(){ }\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file-opener2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Optional variables\r\n\r\nThis plugin requires the Android support library v4. From release `2.1.0` the version of this can be set at installation. The minimum version is `24.1.0`. Default value is `27.+`. [Check out the latest version](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html).\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file-opener2  --variable ANDROID_SUPPORT_V4_VERSION=\"27.+\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using the `cordova-android-support-gradle-release` plugin it should match the value you have set there.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe following platforms and versions are supported by the latest release:\r\n\r\n- Android 4.4+ / iOS 9+ / Windows / Electron\r\n- Cordova CLI 7.0 or higher\r\n\r\nCordova CLI 6.0 is supported by 2.0.19, but there are a number of issues, particularly with Android builds (see [232](https://github.com/pwlin/cordova-plugin-file-opener2/issues/232) [203](https://github.com/pwlin/cordova-plugin-file-opener2/issues/203) [207](https://github.com/pwlin/cordova-plugin-file-opener2/issues/207)). Using the [cordova-android-support-gradle-release](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-android-support-gradle-release) plugin may help.\r\n\r\n### AndroidX Support\r\n\r\nCurrently if your project requires AndroidX support, you need to add the following two plugins to your project:\r\n\r\n- [cordova-plugin-androidx](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx/) and [cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter/)\r\n```shell\r\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-androidx\r\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter\r\n```\r\nJust adding these plugins should be enough and no further changes are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n## fileOpener2.open(filePath, mimeType, options)\r\n\r\nOpens a file\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\n\r\n- Android 4.4+\r\n- iOS 9+\r\n- Windows\r\n- Electron\r\n\r\n### Quick Examples\r\nOpen an APK install dialog:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.open(\r\n    '/Downloads/gmail.apk',\r\n    'application/vnd.android.package-archive'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen a PDF document with the default PDF reader and optional callback object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.open(\r\n    '/Download/starwars.pdf', // You can also use a Cordova-style file uri: cdvfile://localhost/persistent/Downloads/starwars.pdf\r\n    'application/pdf',\r\n    {\r\n        error : function(e) {\r\n            console.log('Error status: ' + e.status + ' - Error message: ' + e.message);\r\n        },\r\n        success : function () {\r\n            console.log('file opened successfully');\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Note on Electron:__ Do not forget to enable Node.js in your app by adding `\"nodeIntegration\": true` to `platforms/electron/platform_www/cdv-electron-settings.json` file, See [Cordova-Electron documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/electron/index.html#customizing-the-application's-window-options).\r\n\r\n### Market place installation\r\nInstall From Market: to install an APK from a market place, such as Google Play or the App Store, you can use an `<a>` tag in combination with the `market://` protocol:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"market://details?id=xxxx\" target=\"_system\">Install from Google Play</a>\r\n<a href=\"itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/my-app/idxxxxxxxx?mt=8\" target=\"_system\">Install from App Store</a>\r\n```\r\nor in code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.open(\"[market:// or itms-apps:// link]\",\"_system\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## fileOpener2.showOpenWithDialog(filePath, mimeType, options)\r\n\r\nOpens with system modal to open file with an already installed app.\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\n\r\n- Android 4.4+\r\n- iOS 9+\r\n\r\n### Quick Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.showOpenWithDialog(\r\n    '/Downloads/starwars.pdf', // You can also use a Cordova-style file uri: cdvfile://localhost/persistent/Downloads/starwars.pdf\r\n    'application/pdf',\r\n    {\r\n        error : function(e) {\r\n            console.log('Error status: ' + e.status + ' - Error message: ' + e.message);\r\n        },\r\n        success : function () {\r\n            console.log('file opened successfully');\r\n        },\r\n        position : [0, 0]\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n`position` array of coordinates from top-left device screen, use for iOS dialog positioning.\r\n\r\n## fileOpener2.uninstall(packageId, callbackContext)\r\n\r\nUninstall a package with its ID. \r\n\r\n__Note__: You need to add `<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES\" />` to your `AndroidManifest.xml`\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\n\r\n- Android 4.4+\r\n\r\n### Quick Example\r\n```js\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.uninstall('com.zynga.FarmVille2CountryEscape', {\r\n    error : function(e) {\r\n        console.log('Error status: ' + e.status + ' - Error message: ' + e.message);\r\n    },\r\n    success : function() {\r\n        console.log('Uninstall intent activity started.');\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## fileOpener2.appIsInstalled(packageId, callbackContext)\r\n\r\nCheck if an app is already installed.\r\n\r\n### Supported Platforms\r\n\r\n- Android 4.4+\r\n\r\n### Quick Example\r\n```javascript\r\ncordova.plugins.fileOpener2.appIsInstalled('com.adobe.reader', {\r\n    success : function(res) {\r\n        if (res.status === 0) {\r\n            console.log('Adobe Reader is not installed.');\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log('Adobe Reader is installed.')\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Android APK installation limitation\r\n\r\nThe following limitations apply when opening an APK file for installation:\r\n- On Android 8+, your application must have the `ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE` permission. You can add it by adding this to your app's `config.xml` file:\r\n```xml\r\n<platform name=\"android\">\r\n    <config-file parent=\"/manifest\" target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES\" />\r\n    </config-file>\r\n</platform>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Before Android 7, you can only install APKs from the \"external\" partition. For example, you can install from `cordova.file.externalDataDirectory`, but **not** from `cordova.file.dataDirectory`. Android 7+ does not have this limitation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## SD card limitation on Android\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible to open a file from the SD Card using this plugin on Android. This is because the underlying  Android library used [does not support serving files from secondary external storage devices](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40318116/fileprovider-and-secondary-external-storage). Whether or not your the SD card is treated as a secondary external device depends on your particular phone's set up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- For properly opening _any_ file, you must already have a suitable reader for that particular file type installed on your device. Otherwise this will not work.\r\n\r\n- [It is reported](https://github.com/pwlin/cordova-plugin-file-opener2/issues/2#issuecomment-41295793) that in iOS, you might need to remove `<preference name=\"iosPersistentFileLocation\" value=\"Library\" />` from your `config.xml`\r\n\r\n- If you are wondering what MIME-type should you pass as the second argument to `open` function, [here is a list of all known MIME-types](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types?view=co)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Description\n\nThis plugin allows you to use the native sharing window of your mobile device.\n\n* Share text, a link, a images (or other files like pdf or ics). Subject is also supported, when the receiving app supports it.\n* Supports sharing files from the internet, the local filesystem, or from the www folder.\n* You can skip the sharing dialog and directly share to Twitter, Facebook, or other apps.\n* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).\n* Officially supported by [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins).\n\n## 2. Screenshots\niOS 7 (iPhone)\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshot-ios7-share.png)\n\nSharing options are based on what has been setup in the device settings\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshots-ios7-shareconfig.png)\n\niOS 7 (iPad) - a popup like this requires [a little more effort](#4c-share-popover-on-ipad)\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshot-ios7-ipad-share.png)\n\niOS 6 (iPhone)\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshot-ios6-share.png)\n\nAndroid\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshot-android-share.png)\n\nWindows Phone 8\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/master/screenshots/screenshot-wp8-share.jpg)\n\n#### Alternative ShareSheet (iOS only, using the [Cordova ActionSheet plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-actionsheet))\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-actionsheet/master/screenshots/ios/ios-share.png)\n\n## 3. Installation\n\n### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)\nSocialSharing is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI:\n\n```\n$ phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin.git\n```\n\nor with Cordova CLI, from npm:\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing\n$ cordova prepare\n```\n\nSocialSharing.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.\n\n### Manually\n\n1\\. Add the following xml to all the `config.xml` files you can find:\n```xml\n<!-- for iOS -->\n<feature name=\"SocialSharing\">\n  <param name=\"ios-package\" value=\"SocialSharing\" />\n</feature>\n```\n```xml\n<!-- for Android (you will find one in res/xml) -->\n<feature name=\"SocialSharing\">\n  <param name=\"android-package\" value=\"nl.xservices.plugins.SocialSharing\" />\n</feature>\n```\n```xml\n<!-- for Windows Phone -->\n<feature name=\"SocialSharing\">\n  <param name=\"wp-package\" value=\"SocialSharing\"/>\n</feature>\n```\n\nFor sharing remote images (or other files) on Android, the file needs to be stored locally first, so add this permission to `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n```\n\nFor iOS, you'll need to add the `Social.framework` and `MessageUI.framework` to your project. Click your project, Build Phases, Link Binary With Libraries, search for and add `Social.framework` and `MessageUI.framework`.\n\n2\\. Grab a copy of SocialSharing.js, add it to your project and reference it in `index.html`:\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/SocialSharing.js\"></script>\n```\n\n3\\. Download the source files for iOS and/or Android and copy them to your project.\n\niOS: Copy `SocialSharing.h` and `SocialSharing.m` to `platforms/ios/<ProjectName>/Plugins`\n\nAndroid: Copy `SocialSharing.java` to `platforms/android/src/nl/xservices/plugins` (create the folders)\n\nWindow Phone: Copy `SocialSharing.cs` to `platforms/wp8/Plugins/nl.x-services.plugins.socialsharing` (create the folders)\n\n### PhoneGap Build\nJust add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin (which is published to plugins.cordova.io these days):\n```xml\n<gap:plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing\" source=\"npm\" />\n```\nor to use an older version, hosted at phonegap build:\n```xml\n<gap:plugin name=\"nl.x-services.plugins.socialsharing\" version=\"4.3.16\" />\n```\n\nSocialSharing.js is brought in automatically. Make sure though you include a reference to cordova.js in your index.html's head:\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"cordova.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## 4. Usage on iOS and Android\nYou can share text, a subject (in case the user selects the email application), (any type and location of) file (like an image), and a link.\nHowever, what exactly gets shared, depends on the application the user chooses to complete the action. A few examples:\n- Mail: message, subject, file.\n- Twitter: message, image (other filetypes are not supported), link (which is automatically shortened if the Twitter client deems it necessary).\n- Google+ / Hangouts (Android only): message, subject, link\n- Flickr: message, image (an image is required for this option to show up).\n- Facebook Android: sharing a message is not possible. You can share either a link or an image (not both), but a description can not be prefilled. See [this Facebook issue which they won't solve](https://developers.facebook.com/x/bugs/332619626816423/). As an alternative you can use `shareViaFacebookWithPasteMessageHint` since plugin version 4.3.4. See below for details. Also note that sharing a URL on a non standard domain (like .fail) [may not work on Android](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/issues/253). Make sure you test this. You can use a [link shortener](https://goo.gl) to workaround this issue.\n- Facebook iOS: message, image (other filetypes are not supported), link. Beware that since a Fb update in April 2015 sharing a prefilled message is no longer possible when the Fb app is installed (like Android), see #344. Alternative: use `shareViaFacebookWithPasteMessageHint`.\n\n### Using the share sheet\nIt's recommended to use `shareWithOptions` as it's the most feature rich way to share stuff cross-platform.\n\nIt will also tell you if sharing to an app completed and which app that was (if that app plays nice, that is).\n\n```js\n// this is the complete list of currently supported params you can pass to the plugin (all optional)\nvar options = {\n  message: 'share this', // not supported on some apps (Facebook, Instagram)\n  subject: 'the subject', // fi. for email\n  files: ['', ''], // an array of filenames either locally or remotely\n  url: 'https://www.website.com/foo/#bar?a=b',\n  chooserTitle: 'Pick an app', // Android only, you can override the default share sheet title\n  appPackageName: 'com.apple.social.facebook', // Android only, you can provide id of the App you want to share with\n  iPadCoordinates: '0,0,0,0' //IOS only iPadCoordinates for where the popover should be point.  Format with x,y,width,height\n};\n\nvar onSuccess = function(result) {\n  console.log(\"Share completed? \" + result.completed); // On Android apps mostly return false even while it's true\n  console.log(\"Shared to app: \" + result.app); // On Android result.app since plugin version 5.4.0 this is no longer empty. On iOS it's empty when sharing is cancelled (result.completed=false)\n};\n\nvar onError = function(msg) {\n  console.log(\"Sharing failed with message: \" + msg);\n};\n\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.shareWithOptions(options, onSuccess, onError);\n```\n\n#### You can still use the older `share` method as well\nHere are some examples you can copy-paste to test the various combinations:\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message only')\">message only</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message and subject', 'The subject')\">message and subject</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, null, 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">link only</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message and link', null, null, 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">message and link</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', null)\">image only</button>\n// Beware: passing a base64 file as 'data:' is not supported on Android 2.x: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7901#c43\n// Hint: when sharing a base64 encoded file on Android you can set the filename by passing it as the subject (second param)\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, 'Android filename', 'data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMALMBAP8AAP///wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAUKAAEALAAAAAAMAAwAQAQZMMhJK7iY4p3nlZ8XgmNlnibXdVqolmhcRQA7', null)\">base64 image only</button>\n// Hint: you can share multiple files by using an array as thirds param: ['file 1','file 2', ..], but beware of this Android Kitkat Facebook issue: [#164]\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message and image', null, 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', null)\">message and image</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message, image and link', null, 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">message, image and link</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message, subject, image and link', 'The subject', 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">message, subject, image and link</button>\n```\n\nExample: share a PDF file from the local www folder:\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Here is your PDF file', 'Your PDF', 'www/files/manual.pdf')\">Share PDF</button>\n```\n\n### Sharing directly to..\n\n#### Twitter\n```html\n<!-- unlike most apps Twitter doesn't like it when you use an array to pass multiple files as the second param -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaTwitter('Message via Twitter')\">message via Twitter</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaTwitter('Message and link via Twitter', null /* img */, 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">msg and link via Twitter</button>\n```\n\n#### Facebook\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaFacebook('Message via Facebook', null /* img */, null /* url */, function() {console.log('share ok')}, function(errormsg){alert(errormsg)})\">msg via Facebook (with errcallback)</button>\n```\n\nFacebook with prefilled message - as a workaround for [this Facebook (Android) bug](https://developers.facebook.com/x/bugs/332619626816423/). BEWARE: it's against Facebooks policy to prefil the message, or even hint the user to prefill a message for them. [See this page for details.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/prefill)\n\n* On Android the user will see a Toast message with a message you control (default: \"If you like you can paste a message from your clipboard\").\n* On iOS this function used to behave the same as `shareViaFacebook`, but since 4.3.18 a short message is shown prompting the user to paste a message (like Android). This message is not shown in case the Fb app is not installed since the internal iOS Fb share widget still supports prefilling the message.\n* iOS9 quirk: if you want to use this method, you need to whitelist `fb://` in your .plist file.\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaFacebookWithPasteMessageHint('Message via Facebook', null /* img */, null /* url */, 'Paste it dude!', function() {console.log('share ok')}, function(errormsg){alert(errormsg)})\">msg via Facebook (with errcallback)</button>\n```\n\nWhitelisting Facebook in your app's .plist:\n```xml\n<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>\n<array>\n  <string>fb</string>\n</array>\n```\n\n#### Instagram\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaInstagram('Message via Instagram', 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', function() {console.log('share ok')}, function(errormsg){alert(errormsg)})\">msg via Instagram</button>\n```\n\nQuirks:\n* Instagram no longer permits prefilling a message - you can prompt the user to paste the message you've passed to the plugin because we're adding it to the clipboard for you.\n\niOS Quirks:\n* Before trying to invoke `shareViaInstagram` please use `canShareVia('instagram'..` AND whitelist the urlscheme (see below).\n* Although this plugin follows the Instagram sharing guidelines, the user may not only see Instagram in the share sheet, but also other apps that listen to the \"Instagram sharing ID\". Just google \"com.instagram.exclusivegram\" and you see what I mean.\n\n\n#### WhatsApp\n* Note that on iOS when sharing an image and text, only the image is shared - let's hope WhatsApp creates a proper iOS extension to fix this.\n* Before using this method you may want to use `canShareVia('whatsapp'..` (see below).\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaWhatsApp('Message via WhatsApp', null /* img */, null /* url */, function() {console.log('share ok')}, function(errormsg){alert(errormsg)})\">msg via WhatsApp (with errcallback)</button>\n```\n\n##### Sharing directly to someone\nNote that on Android you can only send a 'text' and 'url' directly to someone, so files are ignored.\n\n###### By phone number\n\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaWhatsAppToPhone('+31611111111', 'Message via WhatsApp', null /* img */, null /* url */, function() {console.log('share ok')})\">msg via WhatsApp to phone number +31611111111</button>\n```\n\n###### By \"abid\" (iOS) or phone number (Android)\n\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaWhatsAppToReceiver('101', 'Message via WhatsApp', null /* img */, null /* url */, function() {console.log('share ok')})\">msg via WhatsApp for Addressbook ID 101</button>\n```\nThe first argument on iOS needs to be the Addressbook ID (or 'abid'). You can find those abid's by using the [Cordova Contacts Plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts).\nThe result in the success callback of the `find` function is a JSON array of contact objects, use the 'id' you find in those objects.\nDon't pass in an image on iOS because that can't be sent to someone directly unfortunately. Message and URL are fine though.\n\nOn Android pass in the phone number of the person you want to send a message to.\n\n#### SMS\nNote that on Android, SMS via Hangouts may not behave correctly\n```html\n<!-- Want to share a prefilled SMS text? -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaSMS('My cool message', null /* see the note below */, function(msg) {console.log('ok: ' + msg)}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">share via SMS</button>\n<!-- Want to prefill some phonenumbers as well? Pass this instead of null. Important notes: For stable usage of shareViaSMS on Android 4.4 and up you require to add at least one phonenumber! Also, on Android make sure you use v4.0.3 or higher of this plugin, otherwise sharing multiple numbers to non-Samsung devices will fail -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaSMS('My cool message', '0612345678,0687654321', function(msg) {console.log('ok: ' + msg)}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">share via SMS</button>\n<!-- Need a subject and even image sharing? It's only supported on iOS for now and falls back to just message sharing on Android -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaSMS({'message':'My cool message', 'subject':'The subject', 'image':'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png'}, '0612345678,0687654321', function(msg) {console.log('ok: ' + msg)}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">share via SMS</button>\n```\n\n#### Email\nCode inspired by the [EmailComposer plugin](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer), note that this is not supported on the iOS 8 simulator (an alert will be shown if your try to).\n```js\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaEmail(\n  'Message', // can contain HTML tags, but support on Android is rather limited:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15136480/how-to-send-html-content-with-image-through-android-default-email-client\n  'Subject',\n  ['to@person1.com', 'to@person2.com'], // TO: must be null or an array\n  ['cc@person1.com'], // CC: must be null or an array\n  null, // BCC: must be null or an array\n  ['https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png','www/localimage.png'], // FILES: can be null, a string, or an array\n  onSuccess, // called when sharing worked, but also when the user cancelled sharing via email. On iOS, the callbacks' boolean result parameter is true when sharing worked, false if cancelled. On Android, this parameter is always true so it can't be used). See section \"Notes about the successCallback\" below.\n  onError // called when sh*t hits the fan\n);\n```\n\nIf Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, SMS or Email is not available, the errorCallback is called with the text 'not available'.\n\nIf you feel lucky, you can even try to start any application with the `shareVia` function:\n```html\n<!-- start facebook on iOS (same as `shareViaFacebook`), if Facebook is not installed, the errorcallback will be invoked with message 'not available' -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareVia('com.apple.social.facebook', 'Message via FB', null, null, null, function(){console.log('share ok')}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">message via Facebook</button>\n<!-- start facebook on Android (same as `shareViaFacebook`), if Facebook is not installed, the errorcallback will be invoked with message 'not available' -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareVia('facebook', 'Message via FB', null, null, null, function(){console.log('share ok')}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">message via Facebook</button>\n<!-- start twitter on iOS (same as `shareViaTwitter`), if Twitter is not installed, the errorcallback will be invoked with message 'not available' -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareVia('com.apple.social.twitter', 'Message via Twitter', null, null, 'http://www.x-services.nl', function(){console.log('share ok')}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">message and link via Twitter on iOS</button>\n<!-- if you share to a non existing/supported app, the errorcallback will be invoked with message 'not available' -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.shareVia('bogus_app', 'Message via Bogus App', null, null, null, function(){console.log('share ok')}, function(msg) {alert('error: ' + msg)})\">message via Bogus App</button>\n```\n\nWhat can we pass to the `shareVia` function?\n* iOS: You are limited to 'com.apple.social.[facebook | twitter | sinaweibo | tencentweibo]'. If an app does not exist, the errorcallback is invoked and iOS shows a popup message asking the user to configure the app.\n* Android: Anything that would otherwise appear in the sharing dialoge (in case the `share` function was used. Pass a (part of the) packagename of the app you want to share to. The `shareViaFacebook` function for instance uses `com.facebook.katana` as the packagename fragment. Things like `weibo`, `pinterest` and `com.google.android.apps.plus` (Google+) should work just fine.\n\nYou can even test if a sharing option is available with `canShareVia`!\nYou'll need to pass everything you want to share, because (at least on Android) some apps may only become available when an image is added.\nThe function will invoke the successCallback when it can be shared to via `shareVia`, and the errorCallback if not. As a bonus on Android, the errorCallback contains a JSON Array of available packages you can pass to shareVia.\nYou can even specify the activity if the app offers multiple sharing ways, passing 'packageName/activityName'. (for example, WeChat, passing 'com.tencent.mm' or 'com.tencent.mm/com.tencent.mm.ui.tools.ShareImgUI' to share to chat, passing 'com.tencent.mm/com.tencent.mm.ui.tools.ShareToTimeLineUI' to share to moments).\n\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareVia('com.tencent.mm/com.tencent.mm.ui.tools.ShareToTimeLineUI', 'msg', null, img, null, function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is WeChat available on Android?</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareVia('com.apple.social.facebook', 'msg', null, null, null, function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is facebook available on iOS?</button>\n// this one requires whitelisting of whatsapp:// on iOS9 in your .plist file\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareVia('whatsapp', 'msg', null, null, null, function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is WhatsApp available?</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareVia('sms', 'msg', null, null, null, function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is SMS available?</button>\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareVia('instagram', 'msg', null, null, null, function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is Instagram available?</button>\n<!-- Email is a different beast, so I added a specific method for it -->\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.canShareViaEmail(function(e){alert(e)}, function(e){alert(e)})\">is Email available?</button>\n```\n\nWant to share images from a local folder (like an image you just selected from the CameraRoll)?\n```javascript\n// use a local image from inside the www folder:\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, 'www/image.gif', null); // success/error callback params may be added as 5th and 6th param\n// .. or a local image from anywhere else (if permitted):\n// local-iOS:\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, '/Users/username/Library/Application Support/iPhone/6.1/Applications/25A1E7CF-079F-438D-823B-55C6F8CD2DC0/Documents/.nl.x-services.appname/pics/img.jpg');\n// local-iOS-alt:\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, 'file:///Users/username/Library/Application Support/iPhone/6.1/Applications/25A1E7CF-079F-438D-823B-55C6F8CD2DC0/Documents/.nl.x-services.appname/pics/img.jpg');\n// local-Android:\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, 'file:///storage/emulated/0/nl.xservices.testapp/5359/Photos/16832/Thumb.jpg');\n// .. or an image from the internet:\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(null, null, 'http://domain.com/image.jpg');\n```\n\nIf you can't get the plugin to work, have a look at [this demo project](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/X-Services-PhoneGap-Build-Plugins-Demo).\n\n#### Notes about the successCallback (you can just ignore the callbacks if you like)\nThe plugin passes a boolean to the successCallback to let the app know whether or not content was actually shared, or the share widget was closed by the user.\nOn iOS this works as expected (except for Facebook, in case the app is installed), but on Android some sharing targets may return false, even though sharing succeeded. This is not a limitation of the plugin, it's the target app which doesn't play nice.\nTo make it more confusing, when sharing via SMS on Android, you'll likely always have the successCallback invoked. Thanks Google.\n\n#### Sharing multiple images (or other files)\nYou can pass an array of files to the share and shareVia functions.\n\n```js\n// sharing multiple images via Facebook (you can mix protocols and file locations)\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.shareViaFacebook(\n  'Optional message, may be ignored by Facebook app',\n  ['https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png','www/image.gif'],\n  null);\n\n// sharing a PDF and an image\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share(\n  'Optional message',\n  'Optional title',\n  ['www/manual.pdf','https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png'],\n  'http://www.myurl.com');\n```\n\nNote that a lot of apps support sharing multiple files, but Twitter just doesn't accept more that one file.\n\n#### Saving images to the photo album (iOS only currently)\nYou can save an array of images to the camera roll:\n\n```js\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.saveToPhotoAlbum(\n  ['https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png','www/image.gif'],\n  onSuccess, // optional success function\n  onError    // optional error function\n);\n```\n\n#### iOS quirk (with camera plugin)\nWhen using this plugin in the callback of the Phonegap camera plugin, wrap the call to `share()` in a `setTimeout()`.\nThe share widget has the same limitation as the alert dialogue [mentioned in the Phonegap documentation](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.9.0/cordova_camera_camera.md.html#camera.getPicture_ios_quirks).\n\n#### Excluding some options from the widget\nIf you want to exclude (for example) the assign-to-contact and copy-to-pasteboard options, add this to your main plist file:\n\n```xml\n<key>SocialSharingExcludeActivities</key>\n<array>\n  <string>com.apple.UIKit.activity.AssignToContact</string>\n  <string>com.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard</string>\n</array>\n```\n\nHere's the list of available activities you can disable :\n\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToFacebook\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToTwitter\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToFlickr\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToWeibo\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToVimeo\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.TencentWeibo\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.Message\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.Print\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.AssignToContact\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.SaveToCameraRoll\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.AddToReadingList\n - com.apple.UIKit.activity.AirDrop\n\n## 5. Web Share API\n\nChrome introduced the [Web Share API](https://github.com/WICG/web-share) to share data:\n\n```js\nnavigator.share({\n  'title': 'Optional title',\n  'text': 'Optional message',\n  'url': 'http://www.myurl.com'\n}).then(function() {\n  console.log('Successful share');\n}).catch(function(error) {\n  console.log('Error sharing:', error)\n});\n```\n\nIt doesn't provide all the options that the other share methods do but it is spec compliant.\n\n## 6. Usage on Windows Phone\nThe available methods on WP8 are: `available`, `canShareViaEmail`, `share`, `shareViaEmail` and `shareViaSMS`.\nCurrently the first two always return true, but this may change in the future in case I can find a way to truly detect the availability.\n\nThe `share` function on WP8 supports two flavours: message only, or a combination of message, title and link.\n\nBeware: for now please pass null values for all non used attributes, like in the examples below.\n\nSharing a message:\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message only', null, null, null)\">message only</button>\n```\n\nSharing a link:\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Optional message', 'Optional title', null, 'http://www.x-services.nl')\">message, title, link</button>\n```\n\nSharing an image (only images from the internet are supported). If you pass more than one image as an array, only the first one is used:\n```html\n<button onclick=\"window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Optional message', 'Optional title', 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', null)\">image only</button>\n```\n\n## 7. Share-popover on iPad\n\n> This no longer works since plugin version 5.5.0, see [this issue](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin/issues/1052).\n\nCarlos Sola-Llonch, a user of this plugin, pointed me at an [iOS document](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIActivityViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html)\nstating \"On iPad, you must present the view controller in a popover. On iPhone and iPod touch, you must present it modally.\"\n\nHe also provided me with the required code to do so (thanks!). I've adapted it a little to make sure current behaviour is\nnot altered, but with a little extra effort you can use this new popover feature.\n\nThe trick is overriding the function `window.plugins.socialsharing.iPadPopupCoordinates` by your own implementation\nto tell the iPad where to show the popup exactly. It need to be a string like \"100,200,300,300\" (left,top,width,height).\n\nYou need to override this method after `deviceready` has fired.\n\nYou have various options, like checking the click event on a button and determine the event.clientX and event.clientY,\nor use this code Carlos showed me to grab the coordinates of a static button somewhere on your page:\n\n```js\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.iPadPopupCoordinates = function() {\n  var rect = document.getElementById('share_button').getBoundingClientRect();\n  return rect.left + \",\" + rect.top + \",\" + rect.width + \",\" + rect.height;\n};\n```\n\nNote that since iOS 8 this popup is the only way Apple allows you to share stuff, so this plugin has been adjusted to use this plugin as standard for iOS 8 and positions\nthe popup at the bottom of the screen (seems like a logical default because that's where it previously was as well).\nYou can however override this position in the same way as explained above.\n\n**Note**: when using the [WkWebView polyfill](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/WKWebView) the `iPadPopupCoordinates` overrides [doesn't work](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/WKWebView/issues/77) so you can call the alternative `setIPadPopupCoordinates` method to define the popup position just before you call the `share` method.\n\nexample :\n\n```js\nvar targetRect = event.targetElement.getBoundingClientRect(),\n    targetBounds = targetRect.left + ',' + targetRect.top + ',' + targetRect.width + ',' + targetRect.height;\n\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.setIPadPopupCoordinates(targetBounds);\nwindow.plugins.socialsharing.share('Hello from iOS :)')\n```\n\n## 8. Whitelisting on iOS\n\nSince iOS 9 you have to make sure to whitelist the applications you want to use for sharing. Without whitelisting \"query schemes\", you may get the error callback invoked when calling the `canShareVia` function (and possibly the `shareVia`). You can verify this is a permissions issue by observing the output in Xcode for something like:\n\n> -canOpenURL: failed for URL: \"whatsapp://app\" - error: \"This app is not allowed to query for scheme whatsapp\"\n\nYou have a few options to prevent this by whitelisting the application you want to share via:\n\n### Directly editing the .plist file\nManually edit the .plist file - either from within Xcode or using a text editor. You can see example entries above (look for `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`). While this is simple to do, the changes may be lost when rebuilding the project or tweaking the platform (e.g. upgrading) and is less recommended.\n\n### Use query schema plugin\nThere is a plugin designed specifically to address query schema whitelisting. You can find the plugin and how to use it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-queries-schemes). In general, after installation, you can change plugin.xml file under the plugin subfolder within the plugins directory of your project to add the required schemas. Here again though, you have to edit an additional file and should take care not to overwrite it when making changes to your project.\n\n### Use Custom Config plugin\nThe Custom Config plugin ([here](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-custom-config)) allows you to add configuration to your platforms \"native\" configuration files (e.g. .plist or AndroidManifest.xml) through the project's main config.xml file.\n\nTo address query schema issue, after installaing the plugin you can edit the iOS platform section of your config.xml (in the project main folder) to include the required entries:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<widget id=\"your.app.id\"\n        version=\"0.9.1\"\n        xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\"\n        xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\n\n    <!-- a bunch of elements like name, description etc -->\n\n    <platform name=\"ios\">\n\n        <!-- add this entry -->\n        <config-file platform=\"ios\" target=\"*-Info.plist\" parent=\"LSApplicationQueriesSchemes\">\n            <array>\n                <string>whatsapp</string>\n                <!-- add more query scheme strings -->\n            </array>\n        </config-file>\n    </platform>\n</widget>\n```\n\nThe advantage with this method is that editing is done in the config.xml file which will most often be in your source control anyway and hence, changes to it will be reserved.\n\n## 9. NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription on iOS\n\nThis plugin requires permissions to the users photos. Since iOS 10 it is required that you provide a description for this access.\n\nThe plugin configures a default description for you. If you do need to customise it, you can set a Cordova variable when installing:\n\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing --variable PHOTO_LIBRARY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION=\"This app uses your photo library\" --variable PHOTO_LIBRARY_ADD_USAGE_DESCRIPTION=\"This app saves images your photo library\"\n```\n\n## 10. Import Types into an Ionic Angular Project\n\nIf you do not already have a typings file definition, create one inside your `src` folder, for example`src/typings.d.ts`\n\nAdd this reference into your typings file definition:\n```\n/// <reference path=\"../node_modules/cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing/types/index.d.ts\" />\n```\n"

What does exactly this means? Calling [`.insert()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/insert.md) method would initiate a file upload and then insert new record into collection. Calling [`.remove()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/remove.md) method would erase stored file and record from MongoDB Collection. And so on, no need to learn new APIs. It's flavored with extra low-level methods like [`.unlink()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/unlink.md) and [`.write()`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/write.md) for complex integrations.\n\n## ToC:\n\n- [Wiki](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/toc.md) - Full documentation\n- [Installation](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#installation)\n  - [ES6 Import](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#es6-import)\n- [API](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#api-overview-full-api):\n  - [Initialize Collection](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#new-filescollectionconfig-isomorphic)\n  - [Upload file](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#insertsettings-autostart-client)\n  - [Stream files](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#stream-files)\n  - [Download Button](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#download-button)\n- [Documentation and tutorials](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/toc.md)\n  - [__Demo apps and examples__](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#demo-application)\n  - [3rd-party storage integration](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/3rd-party-storage.md) examples - AWS S3, DropBox, GridFS and Google Storage\n  - [TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/typescript-definitions.md)\n- [Related Packages](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#related-packages)\n- [Why this package?](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#why-meteor-files)\n- [Help / Support](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#get-support)\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#faq)\n- [Awards](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#awards)\n- [Help & Contribute](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#contribution)\n- [Support this project](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#support-meteor-files-project)\n- [Supporters](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files#supporters)\n\n## Why `Meteor-Files`?\n\n- Compatible with all front-end frameworks from Blaze to [React](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/react-example.md)\n- Upload via `HTTP` and `DDP` transports, [read about difference](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/about-transports.md)\n- Sustainable and resumable uploads, which will survive connection interruption and server reboot (*if a server has persistent storage*)\n- Upload files through computing cloud without persistent File System, like Heroku\n- You need store files at *[GridFS](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/gridfs-bucket-integration.md#use-gridfs-with-gridfsbucket-as-a-storage)*, *[AWS S3](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/aws-s3-integration.md)*, *[Google Storage](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/google-cloud-storage-integration.md)* or *[DropBox](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/dropbox-integration.md)*?

Use *[`onBeforeUpload`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/constructor.md)* hook\n- You need to [resize images](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files-Demos/blob/master/demo/imports/server/image-processing.js#L19) after upload? Easy too! Use *[`onAfterUpload`](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/constructor.md)* hook, and *[manage file's subversions](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/file-subversions.md)* in a single record\n\n## Installation:\n\n```shell\nmeteor add ostrio:files\n```\n\n### ES6

isn't passed into [*Constructor*](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/constructor.md) it's equals to `assets/app/uploads` and relative to running script:\n    - __a.__ On `development` stage: `yourDevAppDir/.meteor/local/build/programs/server`. __Note: All files will be removed as soon as your application rebuilds__ or you run `meteor reset`. To keep your storage persistent during development use an absolute path *outside of your project folder*, e.g. `/data` directory.\n    - __b.__ On `production`: `yourProdAppDir/programs/server`. __Note: If using MeteorUp (MUP), Docker volumes must to be added to__ `mup.json`, see [MUP usage](hhttps://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/meteorup-usage.md)\n2. __Cordova usage and development__: With support of community we do regular testing on virtual and real devices. To make sure `Meteor-Files` library runs smoothly in Cordova environment — enable [withCredentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials); enable `{allowQueryStringCookies: true}` and `{allowedOrigins: true}` on both `Client` and `Server`. For more details read [Cookie's repository FAQ](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Cookies#faq)\n3. __How to pause/continue upload and get progress/speed/remaining time?__: see *Object* returned from [`insert` method](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/insert.md)\n4. When using any of `accounts` packages - package `accounts-base` must be explicitly added to `.meteor/packages` above `ostrio:files`\n5. __cURL/POST uploads__ - Take a look on [POST-Example](https://github.com/noris666/Meteor-Files-POST-Example) by [@noris666](https://github.com/noris666)\n6. In __Safari__ (Mobile and Desktop) for `DDP` chunk size is reduced by algorithm, due to error thrown if frame is too big. Limit simultaneous uploads to `6` is recommended for Safari. This issue should be fixed in Safari 11. Switching to `http` transport (*which has no such issue*) is recommended for Safari. See [#458](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues/458)\n7. Make sure you're using single domain for the Meteor app, and the same domain for hosting Meteor-Files endpoints, see [#737](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues/737) for details\n8. When proxying requests to Meteor-Files endpoint make sure protocol `http/1.1` is used, see [#742](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues/742) for details\n\n## Awards:\n\n<a href=\"https://themeteorchef.com/blog/giant-cotton-apron-awards-show\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files-Demos/master/GCAA.png\" width=\"160\">\n</a>\n\n## Get Support:\n\n- [Ask a question via Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files)\n- [Ask a question or submit an issue](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues)\n- [Releases / Changelog / History](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/releases)\n- For more docs and examples [read wiki](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/docs/readme.md)\n\n## Demo application:\n\n- [Live: __files.veliov.com__](https://files.veliov.com)\n- [Source Code Rep](https://github.com/veliovgroup/meteor-files-website#file-sharing-web-app)\n\n## Related Packages:\n\n- [pyfiles (meteor-python-files)](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/meteor-python-files) Python Client for Meteor-Files package\n- [meteor-autoform-file](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/meteor-autoform-file) - Upload and manage files with [autoForm](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform)\n\n## Support Meteor-Files project:\n\n- Star on [GitHub](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files)\n- Star on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/ostrio/files)\n- Share via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FVeliovGroup%2FMeteor-Files) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FVeliovGroup%2FMeteor-Files)\n- [Sponsor via GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/dr-dimitru)\n- [Support via PayPal](https://paypal.me/veliovgroup) — support my open source contributions once or on regular basis\n- Use [ostr.io](https://ostr.io) — [Monitoring](https://snmp-monitoring.com), [Analytics](https://ostr.io/info/web-analytics), [WebSec](https://domain-protection.info), [Web-CRON](https://web-cron.info) and [Pre-rendering](https://prerendering.com) for a website\n\n## Contribution:\n\n- __Want to help?__ Please check [issues](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues) for open and tagged as [`help wanted` issues](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A\"help+wanted\");\n- __Want to contribute?__ Read and follow [PR rules](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE).

**28Mb** (the total bytes of memory obtained from the OS.)\n\n![memory usage](screenshot/memory.png)\n\nTest Command (We use [bat](https://github.com/astaxie/bat) as default cli tool.):\n\n```sh\nfor i in {1..9999999}; do bat -b.N=1000 -b.C=100 POST localhost:8088/api/push notifications:=@notification.json; sleep 1;  done\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nHow to send push notification using `gorush` command? (Android or iOS)\n\n### Download a binary\n\nThe pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded from [release page](https://github.com/appleboy/gorush/releases).\n\nWith `Go` installed\n\n```sh\ngo get -u -v github.com/appleboy/gorush\n```\n\nOn linux\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/appleboy/gorush/releases/download/v1.15.0/gorush-v1.15.0-linux-amd64 -O gorush\n```\n\nOn OS X\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/appleboy/gorush/releases/download/v1.15.0/gorush-v1.15.0-darwin-amd64 -O gorush\n```\n\nOn Windows\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/appleboy/gorush/releases/download/v1.15.0/gorush-v1.15.0-windows-amd64.exe -O gorush.exe\n```\n\nOn macOS, use Homebrew.\n\n```sh\nbrew install --HEAD https://github.com/appleboy/gorush/raw/master/HomebrewFormula/gorush.rb\n```\n\n### Install from source\n\n#### Prerequisite Tools\n\n- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)\n- [Go (at least Go 1.11)](https://golang.org/dl/)\n\n#### Fetch from GitHub\n\nGorush uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest way to get started is to clone Gorush in a directory outside of the GOPATH, as in the following example:\n\n```sh\nmkdir $HOME/src\ncd $HOME/src\ngit clone https://github.com/appleboy/gorush.git\ncd gorush\ngo install\n```\n\nor you can use the `go get` command to install the latest or specific verison.\n\n**Note**: such go get installation aren't guaranteed to work. We recommend using binary installation.\n\n```sh\n# Go 1.16+\ngo install github.com/appleboy/gorush@latest\n\n# Go version < 1.16\ngo get -u github.com/appleboy/gorush@latest\n```\n\n### Command Usage\n\n```sh\n  ________                              .__\n /  _____/   ____ _______  __ __  ______|  |__\n/   \\  ___  /  _ \\\\_  __ \\|  |  \\/  ___/|  |  \\\n\\    \\_\\  \\(  <_> )|  | \\/|  |  /\\___ \\ |   Y  \\\n \\______  / \\____/ |__|   |____//____  >|___|  /\n        \\/                           \\/      \\/\n\nUsage: gorush [options]\n\nServer Options:\n    -A, --address <address>          Address to bind (default: any)\n    -p, --port <port>                Use port for clients (default: 8088)\n    -c, --config <file>              Configuration file path\n    -m, --message <message>          Notification message\n    -t, --token <token>              Notification token\n    -e, --engine <engine>            Storage engine (memory, redis ...)\n    --title <title>                  Notification title\n    --proxy <proxy>                  Proxy URL (support http, https, or socks5)\n    --pid <pid path>                 Process identifier path\n    --redis-addr <redis addr>        Redis addr (default: localhost:6379)\niOS Options:\n    -i, --key <file>                 certificate key file path\n    -P, --password <password>        certificate key password\n    --ios                            enabled iOS (default: false)\n    --production                     iOS production mode (default: false)\nAndroid Options:\n    -k, --apikey <api_key>           Android API Key\n    --android                        enabled android (default: false)\nHuawei Options:\n    -hk, --hmskey <hms_key>          HMS App Secret\n    -hid, --hmsid <hms_id>           HMS App ID\n    --huawei                         enabled huawei (default: false)\nCommon Options:\n    --topic <topic>                  iOS or Android topic message\n    -h, --help                       Show this message\n    -V, --version                    Show version\n```\n\n### Send Android notification\n\nSend single notification with the following command.\n\n```bash\ngorush -android -m \"your message\" -k \"API Key\" -t \"Device token\"\n```\n\nSend messages to topics.\n\n```bash\ngorush --android --topic \"/topics/foo-bar\" \\\n  -m \"This is a Firebase Cloud Messaging Topic Message\" \\\n  -k your_api_key\n```\n\n- `-m`: Notification message.\n- `-k`: [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) api key\n- `-t`: Device token.\n- `--title`: Notification title.\n- `--topic`: Send messages to topics. note: don't add device token.\n- `--proxy`: Set `http`, `https` or `socks5` proxy url.\n\n### Send Huawei (HMS) notification\n\nSend single notification with the following command.\n\n```bash\ngorush -huawei -title \"Gorush with HMS\" -m \"your message\" -hk \"API Key\" -hid \"App ID\" -t \"Device token\"\n```\n\nSend messages to topics.\n\n```bash\ngorush --huawei --topic \"foo-bar\" \\\n  -title \"Gorush with HMS\" \\\n  -m \"This is a Huawei Mobile Services Topic Message\" \\\n  -hk \"API Key\" \\\n  -hid \"App ID\"\n```\n\n- `-m`: Notification message.\n- `-hk`: [Huawei Mobile Services](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Guides/Preparations) api secret key\n- `-t`: Device token.\n- `--title`: Notification title.\n- `--topic`: Send messages to topics. note: don't add device token.\n- `--proxy`: Set `http`, `https` or `socks5` proxy url.\n\n### Send iOS notification\n\nSend single notification with the following command.\n\n```bash\n$ gorush -ios -m \"your message\" -i \"your certificate path\" \\\n  -t \"device token\" --topic \"apns topic\"\n```\n\n- `-m`: Notification message.\n- `-i`: Apple Push Notification Certificate path (`pem` or `p12` file).\n- `-t`: Device token.\n- `--title`: Notification title.\n- `--topic`: The topic of the remote notification.\n- `--password`: The certificate password.\n\nThe default endpoint is APNs development.

You’re going to create an application that uses an [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway) event source to create a simple Hello World RESTful API.\n\n### Build gorush binary\n\nDownload source code first.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/appleboy/gorush.git\ncd gorush && make build_linux_lambda\n```\n\nyou can see the binary file in `release/linux/lambda/` folder\n\n### Deploy gorush application\n\nwe need to build a binary that will run on Linux, and ZIP it up into a deployment package.\n\n```sh\nzip deployment.zip release/linux/lambda/gorush\n```\n\nUpload the `deployment.zip` via web UI or you can try the [drone-lambda](https://github.com/appleboy/drone-lambda) as the following command. it will zip your binary file and upload to AWS Lambda automatically.\n\n```sh\n$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \\\n  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \\\n  drone-lambda --region ap-southeast-1 \\\n  --function-name gorush \\\n  --source release/linux/lambda/gorush\n```\n\n### Without an AWS account\n\nOr you can deploy gorush to alternative solution like [netlify functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/). [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) lets you deploy serverless Lambda functions without an AWS account, and with function management handled directly within Netlify. Please see the netlify.toml file:\n\n```toml\n[build]\n  command = \"./build.sh\"\n  functions = \"release/linux/lambda\"\n\n[build.environment]\n  GO_IMPORT_PATH = \"github.com/appleboy/gorush\"\n  GO111MODULE = \"on\"\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/*\"\n  to = \"/.netlify/functions/gorush/:splat\"\n  status = 200\n```\n\n## Stargazers over time\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starcharts.herokuapp.com/appleboy/gorush.svg)](https://starcharts.herokuapp.com/appleboy/gorush)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2019 Bo-Yi Wu [@appleboy](https://twitter.com/appleboy).\n\nLicensed under the MIT License.\n"

However those Layout classes cannot be extended easily without\nrelying heavily on java reflection.\n\nThe next best thing is probably to add spacing spans to the text. This is what this library is doing.\n\nThe text is parsed and measured and spans are added on the whitespace between words to make the\nlines stretch the full width as much as possible.\nThose spans are very similar to ```ScaleXSpan```, but they do not implement ```ParcelableSpan```\nand are not copied by Copy or Cut and Paste operations.\n\nThe re-parsing of the text is triggered by:\n\n  - a change of the text content.\n  - a re-layout with a different width.\n  - a change in the typeface, text size or text scaleX.\n\n\nSome special characters are not stretched (unless there are more than one in row):\n\n  - thin space\n  - hair space\n  - non breaking space\n\nIndentation spaces are also left as-is to preserve the alignment.\n\nThe lines that do not have any whitespace or that would require the whitespace to be stretched too\nmuch are not justified. The limit for how much stretching is allowed is a factor of 10 by default,\nbut this default can be changed.\n\n\nThe measuring of the text is not completely accurate (due to floating errors, font hinting, ...)\nand as a result, the justification is not perfect and lines can be a few pixels too short. \n\n\nScreenshot\n----------\n\n![](screenshot.jpg)\n\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n  Jerome DAVID - [UNCOPT LLC](http://uncopt.com)\n  \n  We are now making free apps with no ads, and are relying on donations for revenue.\n  \n  Please check out [our apps](http://uncopt.com/android) on\n  [Google Play](http://play.google.com/store/search?q=pub:UNCOPT+LLC) and the [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/dl/android?s=uncopt+llc&showAll=1).\n  \n  You can make a donation through a dedicated app with [Google Play in-app-billing](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uncopt.android.donations)\n  or [Amazon in-app-purchasing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/dl/android?p=com.uncopt.android.donations).\n\n\nLicense\n--------\n\n    Copyright 2013 UNCOPT LLC.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n"

    "text" : "# Android Emulator Container Scripts\n\nThis is a set of minimal scripts to run the emulator in a container for various\nsystems such as Docker, for external consumption. The scripts are compatible\nwith both Python version 2 and 3.\n\n\\*Note that this is still an experimental feature and we recommend installing\nthis tool in a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).\nPlease file issues if you notice that anything is not working as expected.\n\n# Requirements\n\nThese demos are intended to be run on a linux OS. Your system must meet the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n- A Python interpreter must be installed.\n- ADB must be available on the path. ADB comes as part of the [Android\n  SDK](http://www.androiddocs.com/sdk/installing/index.html). Note that\n  installing the command line tools is sufficient.\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/) must be installed. Make\n  sure you can run it as [non-root\n  user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)\n- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed.\n- KVM must be available. You can get access to KVM by running on \"bare metal\",\n  or on a (virtual) machine that provides nested virtualization. If you are planning to run\n  this in the cloud (gce/azure/aws/etc..) you first must make sure you have\n  access to KVM. Details on how to get access to KVM on the various cloud\n  providers can be found here:\n\n  - AWS provides [bare\n    metal](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/02/introducing-five-new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances/)\n    instances that provide access to KVM.\n  - Azure: Follow these\n    [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/nested-virtualization)\n    to enable nested virtualization.\n  - GCE: Follow these\n    [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances)\n    to enable nested virtualization.\n\nKeep in mind that you will see reduced performance if you are making use of\nnested virtualization. The containers have been tested under Debian and Ubuntu running kernel 5.2.17.\n\n_NOTE: The images will not run in docker on mac or windows_\n\n# Quick start with hosted containers.\n\nWe now host a set of containers in a public repository. You can find details about the containers\n[here](REGISTRY.MD). You can now run these containers without building them. For example:\n\n```sh\ndocker run \\\n  -e ADBKEY=\"$(cat ~/.android/adbkey)\" \\\n  --device /dev/kvm \\\n  --publish 8554:8554/tcp \\\n  --publish 5555:5555/tcp  \\\n  us-docker.pkg.dev/android-emulator-268719/images/30-google-x64:30.1.2\n```\n\nThis will pull down the container if it is not locally available and launch it. You can see that is\nstarting:\n\nAfter this you can connect to the device by configuring adb:\n\n```sh\n  adb connect localhost:5555\n```\n\nThe device should now show up after a while as:\n\n```sh\n$ adb devices\n\nList of devices attached\nlocalhost:5555 device\n```\n\nIf you wish to use this in a script you could do the following:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d \\\n  -e ADBKEY=\"$(cat ~/.android/adbkey)\" \\\n  --device /dev/kvm \\\n  --publish 8554:8554/tcp \\\n  --publish 5555:5555/tcp  \\\n  us-docker.pkg.dev/android-emulator-268719/images/30-google-x64:30.1.2\n  adb connect localhost:5555\n  adb wait-for-device\n\n  # The device is now booting, or close to be booted\n\n```\n\nA more detailed script can be found in [run-in-script-example.sh](./run-in-script-example.sh).\n\n# Install in a virtual environment\n\nYou can install the python package as follows:\n\n    source ./configure.sh\n\nThis will activate a virtual environment and make the executable `emu-docker`\navailable. You can get detailed information about the usage by launching it as\nfollows:\n\n    emu-docker -h\n\nYou will have to accept the license agreements before you can create docker containers.\n\n## Quick start, interactively creating and running a docker image\n\nYou can interactively select which version of android and emulator you wish to\nuse by running:\n\n    emu-docker interactive --start\n\nYou will be asked to select a system image and an emulator version, after which\na docker file will be created. The system image and emulator will be downloaded\nto the current directory if needed. The script will provide you with a command\nto see the logs as well as the command to stop the container.\n\nIf the local adb server detected the started container automatically,\nyou have nothing to do to query it through adb. If that's not the case,\nyou can now connect to the running device using adb:\n\n    adb connect localhost:5555\n\nTo check if adb has seen the container, you can use the:\n\n    adb devices\n\ncommand and check if a device is detected.\n\nDo not forget to stop the docker container once you are done!\n\nRead the [section](#Make-the-emulator-accessible-on-the-web) on making the\nemulator available on the web to run the emulator using webrtc\n\n## Obtaining URLs for emulator/system image zip files\n\nIssuing:\n\n    emu-docker list\n\nwill query the currently published Android SDK and output URLs for the zip files\nof:\n\n- Available and currently Docker-compatible system images\n- Currently published and advertised emulator binaries\n\nFor each system image, the API level, variant, ABI, and URL are displayed.

After the two are obtained, we can build a Docker image.\n\nGiven an emulator zip file and a system image zip file, we can build a directory\nthat can be sent to `docker build` via the following invocation of `emu-docker`:\n\n    emu-docker create <emulator-zip> <system-image-zip>  [--dest docker-src-dir\n    (getcwd()/src by default)]\n\nThis places all the right elements to run a docker image, but does not build,\nrun or publish yet. A Linux emulator zip file must be used.\n\n## Building the Docker image: Setting up the source dir\n\nTo build the Docker image corresponding to these emulators and system images:\n\n    docker build <docker-src-dir, either ./src or specified argument to\n    emu_docker.py>\n\nA Docker image ID will output; save this image ID.\n\n## Running the Docker image\n\nWe currently assume that KVM will be used with docker in order to provide CPU\nvirtualization capabilities to the resulting Docker image.\n\nWe provide the following run script:\n\n    ./run.sh <docker-image-id> <additional-emulator-params>\n\nIt does the following:\n\n    docker run -e ADBKEY=\"$(cat ~/.android/adbkey)\" \\\n    --device /dev/kvm \\\n    --publish 8554:8554/tcp \\\n    --publish 5555:5555/tcp <docker-image-id>\n\n- Sets up the ADB key, assuming one exists at ~/.android/adbkey\n- Uses `--device /dev/kvm` to have CPU acceleration\n- Starts the emulator in the docker image with its gRPC service, forwarding the\n  host ports 8554/5555 to container ports 8554/5555 respectively.\n- The gRPC service is used to communicate with the running emulator inside the\n  container.\n\n*Note: You can use a public adbkey by injecting the ADBKEY_PUB variable, i.e.: -e ADBKEY_PUB=\"$(cat ~/.android/adbkey.pub)\"*\n\nYou also have the option to mount a /data partition which the emulator will use\nif available. This enables you to use a tmpfs which can give increased\nperformance, especially in the nested virtualization scenario.\n\nFor example:\n\n    docker run -e ADBKEY=\"$(cat ~/.android/adbkey)\" \\\n    --device /dev/kvm \\\n    --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/data \\\n    --publish 8554:8554/tcp \\\n    --publish 5555:5555/tcp <docker-image-id>\n\n### Running the Docker image with GPU acceleration\n\nWe currently only support hardware acceleration for NVIDIA. In order to make use\nof hardware acceleration you might have to install the NVIDIA docker extensions\nfrom [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) if you are running\nan older version of docker (<19.03). You must make sure you have\na minimal X installation if you are using a cloud instance. For example\n[Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) can be used. You must build the\ncontainers by passing in the --gpu flag:\n\n    emu-docker create stable Q --gpu\n\nYou can now launch the emulator with the `run-with-gpu.sh` script:\n\n    ./run-with-gpu.sh <docker-image-id> <additional-emulator-params>\n\nThe script is similar as to the one described above with the addition that it will:\n\n- Make all the available gpu's available (`--gpu all`)\n- Opens up xhost access for the container\n- Enable the domain socket under /tmp/.X11-unix to communicate with hosts X server\n\nHardware acceleration will significantly improve performance of applications that heavily\nrely on graphics. Note that even though we need a X11 server for gpu acceleration there\nwill be no ui displayed.\n\n## Pushing images to a repository\n\nYou can push the created images to a repository by providing the --push and --repo and\n--tag parameters when creating an image. The --tag parameter is optional and is used\nto indicate the version of the created image. This will default to the build-id of the\nemulator, as system images are rarely updated.\n\nWe adopted the following naming scheme for images:\n\n{api}-{sort}-{abi}\n\nWhere:\n\n- api is the api level\n- sort is one of: _aosp_, _google_, _playstore_\n  - _aosp_: A basic android open source image\n  - _google_: A system image that includes access to Google Play services.\n  - _playstore_: A system image that includes the Google Play Store app and access to Google Play services,\n    including a Google Play tab in the Extended controls dialog that provides a\n    convenient button for updating Google Play services on the device.\n- abi indicates the underlying CPU architecture, which is one of: _x86_, _x86_64_, _a32_, _a64_.\n  Note that arm images are not hardware accelerated and might not be fast enough.\n\nFor example: _29-playstore-x86:30.1.2_ indicates a playstore enabled system\nimage with Q running on 32-bit x86.\n\nAn example invocation for publishing all Q images to google cloud repo could be:\n\n```sh\n    emu-docker -v create --push --repo us.gcr.io/emulator-project/ stable \"Q\"\n```\n\nImages that have been pushed to a repository can be launched directly from the repository.\nFor example:\n\n```sh\n    docker run --device /dev/kvm --publish 8554:8554/tcp --publish 5555:5555/tcp \\\n    us.gcr.io/emulator-project/29-playstore-x86:30.1.2\n```\n\n## Communicating with the emulator in the container\n\n## adb\n\nWe forward the port 5555 for adb access to the emulator running inside the\ncontainer. Adb might not automatically detect the device, so run:\n\n    adb connect localhost:5555\n\nYour device should now show up as:\n\n```sh\n$ adb devices\n\nList of devices attached:\nlocalhost:5555 device\n```\n\n# Make the emulator accessible on the web\n\nThis repository also contains an example that demonstrates how you can use\ndocker to make the emulator accessible through the web. This is done by\ncomposing the following set of docker containers:\n\n- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), an edge and service proxy: The proxy is\n  responsible for the following:\n  - Offer TLS (https) using a self signed certificate\n  - Redirect traffic on port 80 (http) to port 443 (https)\n  - Act as a [gRPC proxy](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/) for the\n    emulator.\n  - Verifying tokens to permit access to the emulator gRPC endpoint.\n  - Redirect other requests to the Nginx component which hosts\n    a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.\n- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), a webserver hosting a compiled React App\n- [Token Service](js/jwt-provider/README.md) a simple token service that hands out\n  [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) tokens to grant access to the emulator.\n- The emulator with a gRPC endpoint and a WebRTC video bridge.\n\n## Important Notice!\n\nIn order to run this sample and be able to interact with the emulator you must\nkeep the following in mind:\n\n- The demo has two methods to display the emulator.\n  1. Create an image every second, which is displayed in the browser. This\n     approach will always work, but gives poor performance.\n  2. Use [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) to display the state of the emulator in\n     real time. This will only work if you are able to create a peer to peer\n     connection to the server hosting the emulator. This is usually not\n     a problem when your server is publicly visible, or if you are running the\n     emulator on your own intranet.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- You will need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n- You must have port 80 and 443 available. The docker containers will create an\n  internal network and expose the http and https ports.\n- You will need to create an emulator docker image, as described in the\n  documentation above.\n- Depending on your network you might need [turn](js/turn/README.MD)\n\n## Running the emulator on the web\n\nIn order to create the web containers you must have the following tools available:\n\n- NodeJS\n- Npm\n\nNext you must create a container with the emulator & system image version you wish to\nuse. For example:\n\n    . ./configure.sh && emu-docker create canary \"P.*x86_64\"\n\n### Running the create script\n\nOnce you have taken care of the steps above you can create the containers using\nthe `create_web_container.sh` script:\n\n```sh\n$ ./create_web_container.sh -h\n   usage: create_web_container.sh [-h] [-a] [-s] [-i] -p user1,pass1,user2,pass2,...\n\n   optional arguments:\n   -h        show this help message and exit.\n   -a        expose adb. Requires ~/.android/adbkey.pub to be available at run.\n   -s        start the container after creation.\n   -p        list of username password pairs.  Defaults to: [jansene,hello]\n   -i        install systemd service, with definition in /opt/emulator\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\n./create_web_container.sh -p user1,passwd1,user2,passwd2,....\n```\n\nThis will do the following:\n\n- Create a virtual environment\n- Configure the token service to give access to the passed in users.\n- Generate a public and private key pair, used to encrypt/decrypt JWT tokens\n- Create the set of containers to interact with the emulator.\n- Note that the systemd service has only been tested on debian/ubuntu.\n\nYou can now launch the container as follows:\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose -f js/docker/docker-compose.yaml up\n```\n\nIf you wish to make ADB available you can apply the overlay found in\njs/docker/development.yaml as follows:\n\n```sh\ndocker-compose -f js/docker/docker-compose.yaml -f js/docker/development.yaml up\n```\n\nPoint your browser to [localhost](http://localhost). You will likely get\na warning due to the usage of the self signed certificate. Once you accept the\ncert you should be able to login and start using the emulator.\n\nKeep the following things in mind when you make the emulator accessible over adb:\n\n- Port 5555 will be exposed in the container.\n- The container must have access to the file: `~/.android/adbkey`. This is\n  the _PRIVATE_ key used by adb. Without this you will not be able to access the device\n  over adb.\n- The adb client you use to connect to the container must have access to the\n  private key (~/.android/adbkey). This is usually the case if you are on the same machine.\n- You must run: `adb connect ip-address-of-container:5555` before you can\n  interact with the device. For example:\n\n```sh\n$ adb connect localhost:5555\n$ adb shell getprop\n```\n# Creating cloud instances\n\nThere is a sample cloud-init script that provides details on how you can configure an instance\nthat will automatically launch and configure an emulator on creation. Details on how to do this\ncan be found [here](cloud-init/README.MD).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nWe have a separate [document](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) related to dealing with\nissues.\n\n### Modifying the demo\n\nDetails on the design and how to modify the React application can be found\n[here](js/README.md)\n"

    "text" : "[![rawdrawandroid](https://github.com/dreua/rawdrawandroid/actions/workflows/install.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dreua/rawdrawandroid/actions/workflows/install.yml)\n\n# rawdrawandroid\n\nEver wanted to write C code and run it on Android?  Sick of multi-megabyte\npackages just to do the most basic of things.  Well, this is a demo of how\nto make your own APKs and build, install and automatically run them in about\n2 seconds, and with an apk size of about 25kB (with API 26).  API 30 (Android R+)\nis unfortunately at 45kB to support ARM64 + ARM32.\n\nWith this framework you get a demo which has:\n * To make a window with OpenGL ES support\n * Accelerometer/gyro input, multi-touch\n * An android keyboard for key input\n * Ability to store asset files in your APK and read them with `AAssetManager`\n * Permissions support for using things like sound. Example in https://github.com/cnlohr/cnfa\n * Directly access USB devices.  Example in https://github.com/cnlohr/androidusbtest\n\n[![Youtube Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Cz_LvaN36Ag/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz_LvaN36Ag \"\")\n\nDISCLAIMER: I take no warranty or responsibility for this code.  Use at your own risk.  I've never released an app on the app store, so there may be some fundamental issue with using this toolset to make commercial apps!\n\nFor support, you can try chatting with folks on my discord: https://discord.com/invite/CCeyWyZ\n\n# Why?\n\nBecause sometimes you want to do things that don't fit into the normal way of doing it and all the discussions online revolve around doing it with all the normal processes.  And those processes change, making it difficult to keep up and do specific things.  By using `Makefile`s it's easy to see what exact commands are executed and add custom rules and tweak your build.  C is a universal language.  Rawdraw operates on everything from an ESP8266, to RaspberryPi, Windows Linux and now, even Android.  Write code once, use it everywhere.\n\nWhen you don't fill your build process with hills of beans, you end up being left with the parts that are important, and not the frivilous parts. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, etc, because everything takes much less time.\n\nA little bit of this also has to do to stick it to all those Luddites on the internet who post \"that's impossible\" or \"you're doing it wrong\" to Stack Overflow questions... Requesting permissions in the JNI \"oh you **have** to do that in Java\" or other dumb stuff like that.  I am completely uninterested in your opinions of what is or is not possible.  This is computer science.  There aren't restrictions.  I can do anything I want.  It's just bits.  You don't own me.\n\nP.S. If you want a bunch of examples of how to do a ton of things in C on Android that you \"need\" java for, scroll to the bottom of this file: https://github.com/cntools/rawdraw/blob/master/CNFGEGLDriver.c - it shows how to use the JNI to marshall a ton of stuff to/from the Android API without needing to jump back into Java/Kotlin land.\n\n# Development Environment\n\nMost of the testing was done on Linux, however @AEFeinstein has done at least cursory testing in Windows.  You still need some components of Android studio set up to use this, so it's generally easier to just install Android studio completely, but there are instructions on sort of how to do it piecemeal for Windows.\n\n## Linux install Android Studio with NDK.\n\nThis set of steps describes how to install Android Studio with NDK support in Linux.  It uses the graphical installer and installs a lot more stuff than the instructions below.  You may be able to mix-and-match these two sets of instructions.  For instance if you are on Linux but don't want to sacrifice 6 GB of disk to the Googs.\n\n**NOTE** You probably should use the WSL instructions instead of these instructions as it will produc a more lean installation.\n\n1) Install prerequisites:\n```\n\t# sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless adb\n```\n2) Download Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio\n3) Start 'studio.sh' in android-studio/bin\n4) Let it install the SDK.\n5) Go to sdkmanager (\"Configure\" button in bottom right)\n6) Probably want to use Android 24, so select that from the list.\n7) Select \"SDK Tools\" -> \"NDK (Side-by-side)\"\n8) Download this repo\n```\n\t# git clone https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid --recurse-submodules\n```\n9) Turn on developer mode on your phone (will vary depending on android version)\n10) Make your own key\n```\n\tmake keystore\n```\n11) Go into developer options on your phone and enable \"USB debugging\" make sure to select always allow.\n12) Plug your phone into the computer.\n13) Run your program.\n```\n\tmake push run\n```\n\n## Steps for GUI-less install (Windows, WSL)\n\nIf you're developing in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), follow the \"Steps for GUI-less install\" to install the Android components from the command line, without any GUI components.\n\n### Extra note for actually deploying to device in Windows\n\nIn order to push the APK to your phone, you need `adb` installed in Windows as well.  You can do that by getting the full Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads or directly https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r24.0.4-windows.zip. Installing the full Android Studio is easier, but you can also get the \"Command line tools only\" and install `adb` from there.  The steps below outline how to do this with the direct link.\n\n### Rest of steps\n\n1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  You can find instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 - we use \"Ubuntu\" for this.\n\n2. Install prerequisites:\n```\n# sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless adb unzip zip\n```\n2. Download \"Command line tools only\": https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads - you can get a URL and use `wget` in WSL to download the tools by clicking on the **\"Linux\"** toolset, then right-clicking on the accept link and saying copy link to location.  Then you can say `wget <link>` in WSL.\n3. Create a folder for the Android SDK and export it. You may want to add that export to your `~/.bashrc`:\n```\n# mkdir ~/android-sdk\n# export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk\n# printf \"\\nexport ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk\\n\" >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n4. Unzip the \"Command line tools only\" file so that `tools` is in your brand new `android-sdk` folder.\n5. Install the SDK and NDK components:\n\nIf you are using **Android 29 or older**, do this.\n```\n# yes | $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=${ANDROID_HOME} --licenses\n# $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=${ANDROID_HOME} \"build-tools;29.0.3\" \"cmake;3.10.2.4988404\" \"ndk;21.1.6352462\" \"patcher;v4\" \"platform-tools\" \"platforms;android-30\" \"tools\"\n```\n\nIf your platform command-line tools are **30 or newer**, the command-line tools will be placed in the cmdline-tools folder. So, you will need to execute the following:\n```\n# yes | $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=${ANDROID_HOME} --licenses\n# $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=${ANDROID_HOME} \"build-tools;30.0.2\" \"cmake;3.10.2.4988404\" \"ndk;21.3.6528147\" \"patcher;v4\" \"platform-tools\" \"platforms;android-30\" \"tools\"\n```\n\n**NOTE** If you are upgrading NDK versions, you may need to remove old versions, this Makefile does not necessarily do the best job at auto-selecting NDK versions.\n\nYou can see all avialable versions of software with this command:\n```\n$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --list --sdk_root=${ANDROID_HOME}\n```\n\n6. Install the Windows ADB toolset.\n```\nmkdir -p $ANDROID_HOME/windows\ncd $ANDROID_HOME/windows\nwget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r24.0.4-windows.zip\nunzip platform-tools_r24.0.4-windows.zip\nexport ADB=$ANDROID_HOME/windows/platform-tools/adb.exe\nprintf \"\\nexport ADB=$ANDROID_HOME/windows/platform-tools/adb.exe\\n\" >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAlternatively, you may want to use https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip for r30.\n\n6. NOTE: because of updates to environment variables, you may want to close and re-open your WSL terminal.\n7. Download this repo\n```\n# git clone https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid --recurse-submodules\n```\n8. Turn on developer mode on your phone (will vary depending on android version)\n9. Go into developer options on your phone and enable \"USB debugging\" make sure to select always allow.\n10. Plug your phone into the computer.\n11. Make your keystore.\n```\nmake keystore\n```\n12. Compile and run your program.\n```\nmake run\n```\n\n# If you are going to use this\n* Check out the example here: https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroidexample\n* You may want to copy-and-paste this project, but, you could probably use it as a submodule.  You may also want to copy-and-paste the submodule.\n* You *MUST* override the app name.  \n  - See in Makefile `APPNAME` and `PACKAGENAME` you should be able to include this project's makefile and override that.\n  - You must also update `AndroidManifest.xml` with whatever name and org you plan to use.\n  - You will need to update: `package` in `<manifest>` to be your `PACKAGENAME` variable in Makefile.\n  - Both `android:label` labels need to reflect your new app name.  They are in your `<application>` and `<activity>` sections.\n  - Update the `android:value` field in `android.app.lib_name`\n \n* If you are using permission you have to prompt for, you must both add it to your `AndroidManifest.xml` as well as check if you have it, and if not, prompt the user.  See helper functions below.  You can see an example of this with `sound_android.c` from ColorChord.  https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord/blob/master/colorchord2/sound_android.c\n* Be sure to uninstall any previously installed apps which would look like this app, if you have a different build by the same name signed with another key, bad things will happen.\n* You can see your log with:\n```\nadb logcat\n```\n * If your app opens and closes instantly, try seeing if there are any missing symbols:\n```\nadb logcat | grep UnsatisfiedLinkError\n```\n\n\n# Helper functions\n\nBecause we are doing this entirelly in the NDK, with the JNI, we won't have the luxury of writing any Java/Kotlin code and calling it.  That means all of the examples online have to be heavily marshalled.  In rawdraw's EGL driver, we have many examples of how to do that.  That said, you can use the following functions which get you most of the way there. \n\n`struct android_app * gapp;`\n\n`int AndroidHasPermissions(const char* perm_name);`\n\n`void AndroidRequestAppPermissions(const char * perm);`\n\n`void AndroidDisplayKeyboard(int pShow);`\n\n`int AndroidGetUnicodeChar( int keyCode, int metaState );`\n\n`int android_width, android_height;`\n\n`extern int android_sdk_version; //Derived at start from property ro.build.version.sdk`\n\n\n# Departures from regular rawdraw.\n\nAlso, above and beyond rawdraw, you *must* implement the following two functions to handle when your apps is suspended or resumed.\n\n`void HandleResume();`\n`void HandleSuspend();`\n\nIn addition to that, the syntax of `HandleMotion(...)` is different, in that instead of the `mask` variable being a mask, it is simply updating that specific pointer.\n\n# Google Play\n\nAs it turns out, Google somehow lets apps built with this onto the store.  Like ColorChord https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord.\n\n## Part 0: Changes to your app.\n\n1. Make sure you are using the newest SDK.\n2. You will need to add a versionCode to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.  In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, add `android:versionCode=\"integer\"` to the tag where \"integer\" is a version number.\n3. In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, change `android:debuggable` to false.\n4. You may want to support multiple platforms natively.  Add the following to your `Makefile`: `TARGETS:=makecapk/lib/arm64-v8a/lib$(APPNAME).so makecapk/lib/armeabi-v7a/lib$(APPNAME).so makecapk/lib/x86/lib$(APPNAME).so makecapk/lib/x86_64/lib$(APPNAME).so`\n5. You will need to specify target and Min SDK in your `AndroidManifest.xml`  See: `<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"22\" android:targetSdkVersion=\"28\" />`\n6. Those target / min versions must match your Makefile.  Note that without a `minSdkVerson` google will wrongfully assume 1.  This is dangerous.  Be sure to test your app on a device with whichever minSdkVersion you've specified.\n7.  You will need to disable the debuggable flag in your app.  See `<application android:debuggable=\"false\" ...>`\n\n\nGet a google play account.  Details surrounding app creation are outside the scope of this readme.  When getting ready to upload your APK.\n\n## Keys:  You will want a key for yourself that's a real key.  Not the fake one.\n\nFirst you will need to make a real key.  This can be accomplished by deleting our fake key `my-release-key.keystore` and executing the following command (being careful to fill `####` in with real info): \n\n```make keystore STOREPASS=#### DNAME=\"\\\"CN=####, OU=ID, O=####, L=####, S=####, C=####\\\"\" ALIASNAME=####```\n\nThe alias name will be `standkey`. You will want to verify you can build your app with this key.  Be sure to fill in STOREPASS the same.\n\n```make clean run  STOREPASS=####```\n\n\n## Let Google create and manage my app signing key (recommended) \n\n\n## Export and upload a key and certificate from a Java keystore \n\nIf you want to use the play store key with \"Export and upload a key and certificate from a Java keystore\" Instead of `Let Google create and manage my app signing key (recommended)` and follow PEKP instructions.\n\n## Prepping your app for upload.\n\nYou MUST have aligned ZIPs for the Play store.  You must run the following command:\n\n```zipalign -c -v 8 makecapk.apk```\n\nUpload your APK `makecapk.apk` made with your key.\n\n\n\n# TODO\n\nTry a bunch of these cool priveleges, see what they all do.\n* permission.ACCESS\n* permission.INTERNET\n* permission.HIDE_NON_SYSTEM_OVERLAY_WINDOWS\n* permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\n* permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\n* permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\n* permission.GET_TASKS\n* permission.REORDER_TASKS\n* permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS\n* permission.READ_SECURE_SETTINGS\n* permission.READ_SETTINGS\n* permission.REAL_GET_TASKS\n* permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS\n* permission.MANAGE_USERS\n* permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES\n* permission.DELETE_PACKAGES\n* permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\n* permission.READ_MEDIA_STORAGE\n* permission.WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE\n* android.permission.VR\n* android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text" : "# Image Comparator\n\nImage comparator which computes similarity between images to detect duplicates on the Android platform. It uses the OpenCV manager and different algorithms to compare images and help you find an optimized method to detect duplicate images for your application.\nImage comparison is optimized with the following parameters:\n1. Minimum distance between keypoints described to be accepted as duplicates. The lower the minimum distance matches, the higher the chances of the images being duplicate.\n2. Different algorithms for varying speed and accuracy. ORB, BRIEF, BRISK and FREAK. Only [PYRAMID_FAST](http://computer-vision-talks.com/2011/01/comparison-of-the-opencvs-feature-detection-algorithms-2/) FeatureDetector is being used as of now to increase speed.\n3. SURF and SIFT aren't available in the open source package since they're patented algorithms.\n\n# Quick Use\nFor finding images which are EXACTLY the same except for compressiong and format, use BRISK with a hamming distance of 10 and a minimum number of good matches of 750.\n\n# How to use\n\nDownload the code and export it as an Android application or download it from [here] (http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28378535/imageComparator.apk). Once you have installed imageComparator, please download OpenCV Manager2.4.4 for Android.\nSelect the images you'd like to compare and change the minimum distance and algorithm to be used in settings and start processing. Once done you can add the results to the log. After enough input, you can statistically find out what the best algorithm and minimum distance for your implementation would be.\n\nIt is used in my application [WhatsAppDuplicateMediaRemover] (http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.torcellite.whatsappduplicatemediaremover)\n\n# To be added/fixed \n [ADD]Graphing log files on a server\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n![Screenshot](screenshot1.png)\n![Screenshot](screenshot2.png)\n![Screenshot](screenshot3.png)\n# License\n\nYou have all rights to use this project, but please feel obligated to give due credit.\n\n# Contribute\n\nFork the project and do a pull request.

It hopes to rescue all of those who want an Echo/Dot but don't want to switch off of Google Music or pay extra for an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription.\n\nThis project is still in its early phases and subject to a bit of change, however it is functional and ready for use! The only catch is that you'll need to run it on your own server for the time being (ideally I'll eventually release this on the Alexa Skills marketplace, but there's a lot of work to do before then). This means that you should be familiar with how to set up your own HTTPS web server for now.\n\n### Notes\n\n**This Skill is not made by nor endorsed by Google.** That being said, it is based off of the wonderful [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi) by [Simon Weber](https://simon.codes), which has been around since 2012, so this should work as long as Google doesn't decide to lock down its APIs in a major way.\n\n**The use of 2FA (2-Factory Authentication) and an app-specific password are highly recommended.** If you fail to use an app-specifc password and 2FA, Google may ask you to reset your password until you use one. There have been multiple reports of logins failed bacause of the failure to follow this step. More info about app-specific passwords [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) and 2FA [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839).\n\n### Supported Echo languages\n\n**This Skill was developed to only work on devices (Echo, Dot, Tap etc) using English(US) on a Amazon US account**\nThis is due to the Skill using features from the [Developer Preview of the ASK Built-in Library](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx2EWC85F6H422/Introducing-the-ASK-Built-in-Library-Developer-Preview-Pre-Built-Models-for-Hund). Which frustratingly has only been made available to developers in the US (edit: six months later and there is still no access for UK/DE).\n\nThere is a workaround for English(UK) and Japanese users if they setup the Skill slightly differently, instructions are included below.\n\nThis language issue only affects the Echo/Amazon side of things and not your Google Music account [#100](https://github.com/stevenleeg/geemusic/issues/100)\n\n## Features\nWhat can this puppy do, you might ask? Here's a list of example phrases that you can try once you get GeeMusic up and running. Remember that each of these phrases needs to be prefixed with \"Alexa, tell Geemusic to...\" in order for Alexa to know that you're requesting music from GeeMusic, not the built-in music services. They're also fuzzy, so feel free to try slight variations of phrases to see if they'll work.\n\n### Currently Implemented\n```\nPlay artist Radiohead\nPlay songs by LCD Soundsystem\nPlay top songs by Nujabes\nPlay music by A Tribe Called Quest\n\nPlay the album Science For Girls\nPlay album Plastic Beach\nPlay the album To Pimp A Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar\nPlay album and The Anonymous Nobody by De La Soul\n\nPlay the song Fitter Happier\nPlay song Cocoa Butter Kisses\nPlay the song Drunk Girls by LCD Soundsystem\nStart a radio station for artist Weezer\nPlay some music (plays your I'm Feeling Lucky station)\nStart playlist Dancy Party\n\nWhat is currently playing?\nLike this song\nDislike this song\nThumbs-up this song\nThumbs-down this song\n\nPlay the latest album by Run The Jewels\nList the latest albums by The Wonder Years\nList all albums by Pink Floyd (up to 25 listed)\nPlay an album by Dryjacket\nPlay a different album\n\nSkip to Scar Tissue by Red Hot Chili Peppers\nJump to Knee Deep by Zac Brown Band\n```\n\nOf course you can also say things like \"Alexa stop,\" \"Alexa next,\" etc.\n\n### Roadmap\n```\nPlay a station for bedtime\nPlay a station for partying\n```\n\n## Setup\nLet's cut right to the chase: how can you enable this skill on your own Dot/Echo? Unfortunately the process is a bit finicky, but I'll try to make it as simple as I can.\n\nThe following instructions have been tested on UNIXy environments, namely OS X, Arch, and Ubuntu. It's great if you are able to get this running on Windows, but if not please do not open an issue, as it is an unsupported environment.\n\n### Start a local development server\nLet's start out by getting the GeeMusic server running on your machine. Before you get started, please note that this server must be running at all times and be publicly accessible to the internet in order for this skill to run. If the server shuts down the party stops.\n\nFirst things first, clone this repository to your server:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/stevenleeg/geemusic.git\n```\n\nNext make sure you have Python 3 installed and `cd` in and install the dependencies, you ideally want to do this within a `virtualenv` if you have it installed, but otherwise you can omit those steps and just run the `pip3 install` line. Note that some of the dependencies require a few packages that you may not already have on your system: `python3-dev`, `libssl-dev`, and `libffi-dev`. On Ubuntu these can be installed by running `sudo apt-get install python3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev`.\n\n```bash\n# Run this if you have virtualenv installed:\n$ virtualenv .venv\n$ source .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Continue on if you have virtualenv or start here if you don't:\n$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nOnce the requirements are installed we'll need to create a file, `.env` to store our credentials. Here's an example:\n\n```\n# Google credentials\nGOOGLE_EMAIL=steve@stevegattuso.me\nGOOGLE_PASSWORD=password\n\n# Publicly accessible URL to your server, WITHOUT trailing slash\nAPP_URL=https://alexa-geemusic.stevegattuso.me\n\n# Debug mode: Set to True or False\nDEBUG_MODE=False\nDEBUG_FORCE_LIBRARY=False  # Forces a subscribed user to use local library playback, rather than the default Store\n```\n\nI would *highly reccomend* that you enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account and only insert an application specific password into this file. Remember that it is stored in plaintext on your local computer! (TODO: fix this!)\n\nOnce you have your `.env` file ready to go, let's start the server. I personally use [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run the server, as it will automatically load the `.env` file into my environment and boot up the webserver. There are surely other ways of doing this, but if you'd like to follow my lead you can run `gem install foreman`.\n\nOnce `foreman` is ready to go, simply run\n\n```bash\n$ foreman start\n```\n\nand you should see your web server start at http://localhost:5000 (although it won't do much if you visit it with your browser).\n\nFor alternatives on setting up your server, see the optional sections, notably the Heroku section if you're not familiar with configuring your own HTTPS server.\n\n## Create the development Skill on Amazon\n\nOpen up the [Alexa Dashboard](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html), click \"Get Started\" in the **Alexa Skills Kit** box. Then click on the yellow \"Add a New Skill\" button in the top right corner.\n\nGoing through the various sections\n\n### Skill Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| Skill Type | Custom Interaction Model |\n| Language | Select US English, UK English or Japanese |\n| Name | Gee Music |\n| Invocation Name | gee music |\n| Audio Player | Yes |\n\n### Interaction model\n\nThis setup varies depending on the language settings your Echo device is using.\n\nSee the note at the top about supported languages. \n\n#### US English users\n\nOn the \"Interaction Model\" step, paste in the contents of [`speech_assets/interactionModel.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenleeg/geemusic/master/speech_assets/interactionModel.json) to the JSON Editor.\n\n#### Other language users\n\nOn the \"Interaction Model\" step, paste in the contents of [`speech_assets/non_us_custom_slot_version/interactionModel.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenleeg/geemusic/master/speech_assets/non_us_custom_slot_version/interactionModel.json) to the JSON Editor.\n\n\n### Configuration\n\nWe'll point our skill at the URL for our development server. Select HTTPS as the endpoint type and enter your server's URL in the corresponding box. Remember that your development server must be publicly accessible AND using HTTPS in order for Amazon to be able to connect/interact with it.\n\nIf your development server is running on a server that is already available on the internet, type its URL (such as `https://geemusic.example.com/alexa`). Make sure you include the `/alexa`, otherwise this won't work!\n\nIf you are running the server on a computer behind a firewall we'll need to expose the server via a tunnel in order for this to work. I usually use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for these situations and have used it to develop this project. To start a tunnel run `ngrok http 4000` in a console window. You should then see a few URLs, one of which being a publicly accessible HTTPS link to your development server. Copy this URL, being sure to append `/alexa` so the final result looks something like `https://[some-code].ngrok.io/alexa`. **Important:** Make sure you update your `.env` file's `APP_URL` to this new URL, otherwise Alexa will not be able to stream music!\n\nYou'll also want to select \"No\" for the \"Account Linking\" field before moving on.\n\n### SSL Certificate\n\nIf using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [heroku](https://heroku.com) select the second option \"My development endpoint is a subdomain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority.\"\n\n### Test\n\nScroll down to the \"Service Simulator\" section, the check the Skill is talking to Alexa correcty enter the word help  _\"help\"_ then click \"Ask Gee Music\", and you'll ideally see some resulting JSON in the Service Response box. You can then try testing phrases like_\"Play album In Rainbows by Radiohead\"_\n\n### Publishing Information, Privacy & Compliance\n\nDo not fill these in and make sure you never click \"SUBMIT FOR CERTIFICATION\". You are NOT submitting the Skill to Amazon to include in the public Skill store.  \n\n----\n\nIf all goes well the skill should also be up and running on your Echo/Dot! Take a look at the features section of this Readme to get an idea of what you can tell it to do.\n\nEnjoy streaming Google Music via Alexa!\n\n## (Optional) Setup a Heroku instance\n\nSetting up an instance on Heroku may be an easier option for you, and these instructions detail how to accomplish this. The following steps replace the need to setup a local server.\n\nFirst, we need to deploy a copy of this code to Heroku. To do that, simply click the Deploy to Heroku button below.\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/stevenleeg/geemusic/tree/master)\n\nOnce you've named your app and the code has been deployed, the next step is to configure the app to work with your Google account. To do this click on the settings tab of Heroku's site. After the tab has loaded, click the button labeled Reveal Config Vars and update the variables below replacing each temporary value with your own values.\n\n| Variable Name  | Value |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| GOOGLE_EMAIL  | YOUR_EMAIL |\n| GOOGLE_PASSWORD  | YOUR_PASSWORD  |\n| APP_URL | https://[heroku_app_name].herokuapp.com |\n| DEBUG_MODE | false |\n\nAt this point, your server should by live and ready to start accepting requests at `https://[heroku_app_name].herokuapp.com/alexa.` Note, that while using the free tier, you may experience timeout errors when you server has received no requests for over 30 minutes. However, you can use a service, such as [Kaffeine](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) to minimize your downtime.\n\n## (Optional) Use Docker\n\nIf you have docker running on a server, running this server as a docker container may make the most sense for your setup. As of right now there is not an image available in the dockerhub, but building the container is very easy.\n\nFirst, clone this repository.\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/stevenleeg/geemusic.git\n```\n\nNow, `cd` in and build the container. We'll tag it 'geemusic', but you can call it whatever you want.\n\n```bash\n$ docker build -t geemusic .\n```\n\nFinally, run the container with the appropriate environment variables and port forwards. Alternatively set up a compose file or your orchestration engine, but those are outside the scope of this readme.\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d -e GOOGLE_EMAIL=steve@stevegattuso.me -e GOOGLE_PASSWORD=[password] \\\n-e APP_URL=http://alexa-geemusic.stevegattuso.me -p 5000:5000 geemusic\n```\n\nAt this point you're set up and ready.\n\n## (Optional) Use AWS Lambda\n*Note this costs about $0.30-$1.00 per month based on usage*\n\nSetting this up for AWS Lambda actually isn't that bad. You need to create an AWS account first though, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), and click \"Create an AWS Account\" and follow the instructions to create the account.\n\nWe are also going to need a few more dependencies, so while you are in your virtualenv type the following: `pip install zappa awscli` and then `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you wish to overwrite the base requirements.txt file with the proper requirements to deploy to AWS.\n\n### Deployment Part 1. Setting up IAM Account.\n\nOnce your account is created:\n  1. Open the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home), and sign in with your account that you should have by now. \n  2. In the navigation pane, choose Users. \n  3. Click the `Add User` button. \n  4. Name the user zappa-deploy, choose `Programmatic` access for the Access type, then click the `Next: Permissions` button. \n  5. On the permissions page, click the Attach existing policies directly option. \n  6. A large list of policies is diplayed. Locate the AdministratorAccess policy, click its checkbox, then click the `Next: Review` button.\n  7. Finally, review the information that displays with the steps above and then click the `Create User` button.\n  8. Once the user is created, its `Access key ID` and `Secret access key` are displayed (click the `Show` link next to the Secret access to show it). \n  9. Keep that tab open or copy them to a safe place because we will need those later. Treat those keys like you would your password because they have the same privileges.\n\n### Deployment Part 2. Configure IAM credentials locally.\n\nType aws configure to begin the local setup.\n\nFollow the propts to input your `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`. For Default region name, type: `us-east-1` (it must be a valid region) For Default output format, accept the default by hitting the Enter key.\n\nThe `aws configure` command installs credentials and config in an .aws directory inside your home directoy. Zappa knows how to use this figuration to create the AWS resources it needs to deploy Flask-Ask skills to Lambda.\n\nWe're now almost ready to deploy our skill with Zappa.\n\n### Deployment Part 3. Deploy the skill with Zappa.\n\nIn the terminal, create a zappa configuration file by typing: `zappa init` or by typing `mv gmusic_zappa_settings.json zappa_settings.json` to copy this skeleton file and update all the `redacted` fields with your own values.\n\n*Note: After a while you might have to grab an old valid working device ID from your account using the `Mobileclient.get_registered_devices()`. You'll have to login via a python shell using the `gmusicapi` on a computer that has a valid device id as Lambda functions don't have a MAC address.*\n\nOnce the initialization is complete, deploy the skill by typing: `zappa deploy dev`\n\nEdit the zappa_settings.json file and fill in the `redacted` information with your own personal information specific to your deployment\n\nThen type the following: `zappa update dev`\n\nFinally you have to update your Alexa Skills Configuration tab to use this URL + /alexa. For example it looks like this, `https://[random-stuff].execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/alexa`. Everything else for the configuration is the same as the heroku setup. \n\nIt still uses a wildcard SSL cert and doesn't use Account linking or list read/writes.\n\n\n\n## (Optional) Last.fm support\n*Only attempt this if you have significant technical expertise.* To scrobble all played tracks to [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm) follow the instructions at [this repo](https://github.com/huberf/lastfm-scrobbler) to get auth tokens.\n\nThen add them as environement variables to your setup (e.g. `LAST_FM_API`, `LAST_FM_API_SECRET`, `LAST_FM_SESSION_KEY`). To finish enabling create a `LAST_FM_ACTIVE` environement variable and set it to `True`.\n\n## (Optional) Language support\nIf your desired language is listed below you can simply set your `LANGUAGE` environment variable to the 2 character country code specified below:\n\n```\n# English\nLANGUAGE=en\n\n# German\nLANGUAGE=de\n\n# French\nLANGUAGE=fr\n```\n\nIf you want to add a language submit a PR to this repository and add translations for the language you want to support in `geemusic/templates/` dir with the global two character country code + `yaml`. For example, the English the file is `geemusic/templates/en.yaml`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n### Pausing/resuming skips to the beginning of the song.\nFlask Ask used to have a bug that would not resume the song from the correct offset. Make sure it, and the rest of your pip modules are up to date.\n\n### Music won't start playing\nIssues where Alexa responds to your requests but doesn't play music are generally caused by the `APP_URL` environment variable being set improperly. Be sure that it is set to something like `APP_URL=https://ff9b5cce.ngrok.io` **without a trailing slash or `/alexa`**.\n\n## Contributing\nPlease feel free to open an issue or PR if you've found a bug. If you're looking to implement a feature, please open an issue before creating a PR so I can review it and make sure it's something that should be added.\n\n## License\nThis project is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

It allows you to list, create, update and destroy Facebook Ad objects (campaigns, ad sets, ads, etc) and get real-time insights about the performance of Facebook Ads.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\ngem install facebook_ads\n```\n\nOr, add the following to your Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'facebook_ads', '~> 0.7'\n```\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou'll need an [Access Token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/authentication) with `ads_management` permissions in order to use Facebook's Marketing API.\n\n```ruby\nFacebookAds.access_token = '[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]'\n```\n\nYou can also optionally include an [App Secret](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/accountkit/graphapi#app-tokens) if you need one for your application.\n\n```ruby\nFacebookAds.app_secret = '[YOUR_APP_SECRET]'\n```\n\n## API Version\n\nThis gem currently defaults v3.2 of the Marketing API. You can change the version as desired with the following:\n\n```ruby\nFacebookAds.base_uri = 'https://graph.facebook.com/[desired-version-here]'\n```\n\n## Console\n\nThis gem provides a console using [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) and [AwesomePrint](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print) for you to test & debug.\nIt reads the Access Token from a file called test_access_token.\n\n```bash\necho [YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN] > test_access_token\nbin/facebook_ads_console\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nA strong understanding of the Facebook Ads [object structure](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/buying-api) will greatly help you use this gem.\n\nThe basic object structure:\n\n![Facebook Ads Object Structure](http://i.imgur.com/Ak4FQ4H.jpg)\n\nIn total, there are 7 Facebook Ads objects that can be interacted with via this gem: AdAccount, AdCampaign, AdImage, AdCreative, AdSet, Ad and AdInsight.\n\nThe typical flow is as follows:\n\n1. Create an **AdCampaign** for an **AdAccount**.\n2. Create **AdImages** for an **AdAccount**.\n3. Create an **AdCreative** for an **AdAccount** using the **AdImages** from #2.\n4. Create ad **AdSet** for the **AdCampaign** from #1.\n5. Create an **Ad** for the **AdSet** from #4 using the **AdCreative** from #3.\n6. Monitor the performance of the **Ad** from #5 using **AdInsights**.\n7. Update the daily budget of the **AdSet** from #4 as needed.\n\nYou'll find usage examples for each of these 7 objects below.\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account) (Fetch, Find, Update)\n\nFetch all accounts that can be accessed using your access token:\n```ruby\naccounts = FacebookAds::AdAccount.all\n```\n\nFind an account by ID:\n```ruby\naccount = FacebookAds::AdAccount.find('act_1132789356764349')\n```\n\nFind an account by name:\n```ruby\naccount = FacebookAds::AdAccount.find_by(name: 'ReFuel4')\n```\n\nUpdate an account (using both .save() and .update()):\n```ruby\naccount.name = 'ReFuel4 [Updated]'\naccount = account.save # Returns the updated object.\naccount.update(name: 'ReFuel4') # Returns a boolean.\n```\n\nThe list of fields that can be updated is [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account#Updating).\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Campaigns](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign-group) (Fetch, Find, Create, Update, Destroy)\n\nFetch all active campaigns:\n```ruby\ncampaigns = account.ad_campaigns\n```\n\nFetch all paused campaigns (can pass multiple statuses in the array):\n```ruby\ncampaigns = account.ad_campaigns(effective_status: ['PAUSED'])\n```\nSee FacebookAds::AdCampaign::STATUSES for a list of all statuses.\n\nFetch all campaigns:\n```ruby\ncampaigns = account.ad_campaigns(effective_status: nil)\n```\n\nCreate a new campaign for website conversions that is initially paused:\n```ruby\ncampaign = account.create_ad_campaign(\n  name: 'Test Campaign',\n  objective: 'CONVERSIONS',\n  status: 'PAUSED'\n)\n```\nSee FacebookAds::AdCampaign::OBJECTIVES for a list of all objectives.\n\nFind a campaign by ID:\n```ruby\ncampaign = FacebookAds::AdCampaign.find(campaign.id)\n```\n\nUpdate a campaign (using both .save() and .update()):\n```ruby\ncampaign.status = 'ACTIVE'\ncampaign = campaign.save # Returns the updated object.\ncampaign.update(status: 'PAUSED') # Returns a boolean.\n```\nThe list of fields that can be updated is [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign-group#Updating).\n\nDestroy a campaign:\n```ruby\ncampaign.destroy\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Images](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-image) (Fetch, Find, Create, Destroy)\n\nNotes:\n* Images cannot be updated.\n* You can upload the same image multiple times and Facebook will de-duplicate them server side.\n* An image will always generate the same hash on Facebook's end - even across ad accounts.\n* Image uploading via a URL currently assumes a \\*nix system (Mac OS, linux). It likely will fail on Windows. A cross-platform tempfile-based solution is in the works.\n* You can't destroy an image if its being used by a creative. You have to destroy the creative first.\n\nFetch all images owned by an account:\n```ruby\nad_images = account.ad_images\n```\n\nCreate images using an array of URLs:\n```ruby\nad_images = account.create_ad_images([\n  'https://d38eepresuu519.cloudfront.net/485674b133dc2f1d66d20c9d52c62bec/original.jpg',\n  'https://d38eepresuu519.cloudfront.net/3977d2a47b584820969e2acf4d923e33/original.jpg'\n])\n```\n\nFind images using their hash values:\n```ruby\nad_images = account.ad_images(hashes: ad_images.map(&:hash))\n```\n\nDestroy images:\n```ruby\nad_images.map(&:destroy)\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Creatives](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-creative) (Fetch, Find, Create, Update, Destroy)\n\nNotes:\n* I'd like to add a configuration object that allows you to specify the Facebook Page, Instagram account, website, iOS app and/or Android app that you will be advertising. This is needed when creating both Ad Creative objects and Ad Set objects.\n\nFetch all creatives owned by an account:\n```ruby\nad_creatives = account.ad_creatives\n```\n\nCreate a carousel creative driving installs for an Android app:\n```ruby\ncarousel_ad_creative = account.create_ad_creative({\n  name: 'Test Carousel Creative',\n  page_id: '300664329976860', # Add your Facebook Page ID here.\n  link: 'http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tophatter', # Add your Play Store ID here.\n  message: 'A message.',\n  assets: [\n    { hash: ad_images.first.hash, title: 'Image #1 Title' },\n    { hash: ad_images.second.hash, title: 'Image #2 Title' }\n  ],\n  call_to_action_type: 'SHOP_NOW',\n  multi_share_optimized: true,\n  multi_share_end_card: false\n}, creative_type: 'carousel')\n```\nSee FacebookAds::AdCreative::CALL_TO_ACTION_TYPES for a list of all call to action types.\n\nCreate a single image creative advertising an Android app:\n```ruby\nimage_ad_creative = account.create_ad_creative({\n  name: 'Test Single Image Creative',\n  page_id: '300664329976860', # Add your Facebook Page ID here.\n  message: 'A message.',\n  link: 'http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tophatter', # Add your Play Store ID here.\n  link_title: 'A link title.',\n  image_hash: ad_images.first.hash,\n  call_to_action_type: 'SHOP_NOW'\n}, creative_type: 'image')\n```\n\nCreate a single creative for a web link:\n```ruby\nimage_ad_creative = account.create_ad_creative({\n  title: 'Test Link Title',\n  body: 'Link Description Text',\n  object_url: 'www.example.com/my-ad-link',\n  link_url: 'www.example.com/my-ad-link',\n  image_hash: ad_images.first.hash,\n}, creative_type: 'link')\n```\n\nThe options will be different depending on the thing being advertised (Android app, iOS app or website).\n\nFind a creative by ID:\n```ruby\nad_creative = FacebookAds::AdCreative.find(ad_creative.id)\n```\n\nUpdate a creative (using both .save() and .update()):\n```ruby\nad_creative.name = 'Test Carousel Creative [Updated]'\nad_creative = ad_creative.save # Returns the updated object.\nad_creative.update(name: 'Test Carousel Creative') # Returns a boolean.\n```\nThe list of fields that can be updated is [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-creative#Updating).\n\nDestroy a creative:\n```ruby\nad_creative.destroy\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Sets](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign) (Fetch, Find, Create, Update, Destroy)\n\nNotes:\n* It's important to make sure your targeting spec makes sense in the context of the promoted object. For example if the promoted object is an iOS app and the targeting spec specifies Android devices your ads are not likely to perform well since no one will be able to download your iOS app.\n\nYou interact with ad sets via a campaign:\n```ruby\ncampaign = account.ad_campaigns(effective_status: nil).first\n```\n\nFetch all active ad sets for a campaign:\n```ruby\nad_sets = campaign.ad_sets\n```\n\nFetch all paused ad sets for a campaign (can pass multiple statuses in the array):\n```ruby\nad_sets = campaign.ad_sets(effective_status: ['PAUSED'])\n```\nSee FacebookAds::AdSet::STATUSES for a list of all statuses.\n\nFetch all ad sets for a campaign:\n```ruby\nad_sets = campaign.ad_sets(effective_status: nil)\n```\n\nSpecify the audience targeted by this ad set:\n```ruby\ntargeting                   = FacebookAds::AdTargeting.new\ntargeting.genders           = [FacebookAds::AdTargeting::WOMEN]\ntargeting.age_min           = 29\ntargeting.age_max           = 65\ntargeting.countries         = ['US']\ntargeting.user_os           = [FacebookAds::AdTargeting::ANDROID_OS]\ntargeting.user_device       = FacebookAds::AdTargeting::ANDROID_DEVICES\ntargeting.app_install_state = FacebookAds::AdTargeting::NOT_INSTALLED\n```\nA lot can be done with targeting. You can learn more about targeting specs [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/targeting-specs).\n\nCreate an ad set to drive installs to an Android app using the targeting above:\n```ruby\nad_set = campaign.create_ad_set(\n  name: 'Test Ad Set',\n  targeting: targeting,\n  promoted_object: { # This can be an Android app, iOS app or pixel ID, plus an optional custom event.\n    application_id: '295802707128640',\n    object_store_url: 'http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tophatter',\n    custom_event_type: 'PURCHASE'\n  },\n  optimization_goal: 'OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS',\n  daily_budget: 500, # This is in cents, so the daily budget here is $5.\n  billing_event: 'IMPRESSIONS',\n  status: 'PAUSED',\n  bid_strategy: 'LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP'\n)\n```\nSee FacebookAds::AdSet::OPTIMIZATION_GOALS for a list of all optimization goals.\nSee FacebookAds::AdSet::BILLING_EVENTS for a list of all billing events.\nSee FacebookAds::AdSet::BID_STRATEGIES for a list of all bid strategies.\n\nFind an ad set by ID:\n```ruby\nad_set = FacebookAds::AdSet.find(ad_set.id)\n```\n\nUpdate an ad set (using both .save() and .update()):\n```ruby\nad_set.status = 'ACTIVE'\nad_set.daily_budget = 400\nad_set = ad_set.save # Returns the updated object.\nad_set.update(status: 'PAUSED', daily_budget: 500) # Returns a boolean.\n```\nThe list of fields that can be updated is [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign#Updating).\n\nDestroy an ad set:\n```ruby\nad_set.destroy\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Set Activities](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-activity) (Fetch)\n\nYou interact with activities via an ad set:\n```ruby\nad_set = account.ad_sets(effective_status: nil).first\n```\n\nFetch all activities in last 24 hours for an ad set:\n```ruby\nactivities = ad_set.activities\n```\n\nFetch all activities in last 48 hours for an ad set:\n```ruby\nactivities = ad_set.activities(from: 2.days.ago, to: Date.today)\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ads](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup) (Fetch, Find, Create, Update, Destroy)\n\nYou interact with ads via an ad set:\n```ruby\nad_set = account.ad_sets(effective_status: nil).first\n```\n\nFetch all active ads for an ad set:\n```ruby\nads = ad_set.ads\n```\n\nFetch all paused ads for an ad set (can pass multiple statuses in the array):\n```ruby\nads = ad_set.ads(effective_status: ['PAUSED'])\n```\nSee FacebookAds::Ad::STATUSES for a list of all statuses.\n\nFetch all ads for an ad set:\n```ruby\nads = ad_set.ads(effective_status: nil)\n```\n\nFetch a creative that we'll use to create an ad:\n```ruby\nad_creative = account.ad_creatives.first\n```\n\nCreate an ad:\n```ruby\nad = ad_set.create_ad(name: 'Test Ad', creative_id: ad_creative.id)\n```\n\nFind an ad by ID:\n```ruby\nad = FacebookAds::Ad.find(ad.id)\n```\n\nUpdate an ad (using both .save() and .update()):\n```ruby\nad.name = 'Test Ad [Updated]'\nad.status = 'ACTIVE'\nad = ad.save # Returns the updated object.\nad.update(name: 'Test Ad', status: 'PAUSED') # Returns a boolean.\n```\nThe list of fields that can be updated is [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup#Updating).\n\nDestroy an ad:\n```ruby\nad.destroy\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Ad Insights](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights/overview) (Fetch)\n\nFetch today's insights for an account:\n```ruby\naccount.ad_insights\n```\n\nFetch yesterday's insights for an account:\n```ruby\naccount.ad_insights(range: Date.yesterday..Date.yesterday)\n```\n\nFetch today's insights for a campaign:\n```ruby\naccount.ad_campaigns.last.ad_insights\n```\n\nFetch yesterday's insights for a campaign:\n```ruby\naccount.ad_campaigns.last.ad_insights(range: Date.yesterday..Date.yesterday)\n```\n\n___\n\n### [Product Catalogs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/product-catalog)\n\nList all product catalogs:\n```ruby\nFacebookAds::AdProductCatalog.all\n```\n\nCreate a new product catalog:\n```ruby\ncatalog = FacebookAds::AdProductCatalog.create(name: 'test')\n```\n\nDelete a product catalog:\n```ruby\ncatalog.destroy\n```\n\n## @TODO:\n\n* [Batch operations](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/batch-requests).\n"

That is\nSubsonic! Now imagine having a Web App to stream your music that is as beautiful and well designed\nas it is functional, that is Jamstash!\n\nWhat?\n\n* HTML5 Music Streaming App for your Subsonic server\n* Archive.org Browsing and Streaming of Live Music\n\n## Features\n\n* HTML5 Audio with Flash fallback (provided by the jPlayer library)\n* HTML5 Notifications\n* Flexible Layout (will scale to whatever size your browser window is)\n* Keyboard shortcuts (back, forward, play/pause, skip to artist, media keys)\n* Playlist support (create new, add to existing, delete)\n* Podcast support (includes description field on hover)\n* Favorite/Starred support for Albums & Songs\n* Shortcuts supported\n* Easy installation (Chrome App or manual install)\n* FF/Chrome support (IE9 works but is a little rough around the edges)\n* Light/Dark Theme\n* Last.fm support\n* Autopilot Mode (click one button and songs continue to play)\n* AutoSave Mode (saves position and current playlist if you close or refresh your browser)\n* Built with AngularJS\n\n**Please submit all bug reports & feature requests via the GitHub page**\nhttps://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash/issues\n\nYou will need a Subsonic server to be able to play your own music. Subsonic is a free, web-based\nmedia streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music. Use it to share your music with friends,\nor to listen to your own music while at work. Please see http://www.subsonic.org\n\n* Hosted version: https://jamstash.com\n* Getting Started https://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash/wiki/Getting-Started\n* Twitter (Release Announcements): https://twitter.com/JamstashApp\n* Github Repo: https://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash\n* Chrome App: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minisub/jccdpflnecheidefpofmlblgebobbloc\n* Forum: http://forum.subsonic.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12\n* Donations: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VMTENRSJWQ234\nChange Log inside...\n\n## Permissions\n\n* You will have to allow Jamstash to \"Access your data on all websites\". This is required because\n  your Subsonic server could be at any URL `http://*/*` or `https://*/*`. This is somewhat\n  misleading, we ask for `*://*/*` access so that developers can make API calls to ANY URL ...\n\nWe don't collect any personal data and we don't want access to your data on all websites, we simply\nhave to use that permission so developers can use the App on all urls.\n\n* I NEVER access, read, modify, store, or transmit your personal data.\n\n* If you want to help star this issue: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=158004\n\nLicense: GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)\nhttps://github.com/tsquillario/Jamstash/blob/master/gpl-2.0.txt\n\n## Contributing\n\nHelp us improve Jamstash!\n\n### Setting up your environment\nIn order to build Jamstash, `npm` is  required. For help installing `npm`, see\n<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>.\n\nOnce `npm` is installed, clone the project to your local machine using `git`.\n\nInstall the project's dependencies by running `npm install && npx bower install`.\n\n### Development and testing\nTo start a server that will continuously build and test your code as you work, run `npx grunt\nserve`. This will open up a browser window with the built app running in it, as well as a Chrome\nbrowser window that runs unit tests. Whenever you change a file, the application is rebuilt and unit\ntests are run. Stop the server with CTRL+C.\n\nTo generate test coverage reports, run `npx grunt coverage`. This will run unit tests as you work\nand generate a code coverage report. Stop it with CTRL+C.\n\nTo do a one-off build of the code, run `npx grunt build`. This will also minify the files for use in\nproduction. At this point, the files in `dist/` can be served up via Apache, Nginx, or any other web\nserver to provide access to the Jamstash application.\n\n### Version bumps and deployment to GitHub Pages\nTypically these tasks will be done by a project maintainer.\n\nJamstash uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). The following commands can be used to\nincrement the project version across `package.json`, `bower.json`, and `manifest.json`:\n```\nnpx grunt bump:major\nnpx grunt bump:minor\nnpx grunt bump:patch\n```\n\nThe public changelog is located in `app/common/json_changelog.json`. When bumping the version, make\nsure to add any notable user-facing changes in this file.\n\nAfter bumping the version, modifying the changelog, and committing the updated files, use `git tag\n<version>` to tag the commit with the current version.\n\nOnce this tag is pushed to GitHub, GitHub Actions should automatically build it, release it, and\ndeploy it to the 'gh-pages' branch (which is served by GitHub Pages).\n\nIf this automated process fails, or GitHub Actions is not available, updating the 'gh-pages' branch\ncan be done locally. The `build-commit.sh` script has been provided to automate this process. Run\n`./build-commit.sh --help` for more information.\n\nAn example of the entire release process:\n```\n# bump the version\nnpx grunt bump:patch\n\n# note changes in the changelog\nvim app/common/json_changelog.json\n\n# commit the files\ngit commit -am \"Bump version to v1.2.3\"\n\n# tag the commit\ngit tag v1.2.3\n\n# push the commit and tag to the repo\ngit push origin master --tags\n\n```\nExtra steps required if not using GitHub Actions:\n```\n# update the gh-pages branch with the current release\n./build-commit.sh v1.2.3\n\n# push the newly-released version to GitHub Pages to deploy it\ngit push origin gh-pages\n```\n"

Is your adversary a [three letter agency](https://theintercept.com/document/2015/03/10/strawhorse-attacking-macos-ios-software-development-kit/) (if so, you may want to consider using [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) instead); a nosy eavesdropper on the network; or a determined [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat) orchestrating a campaign against you?\n\t* [Recognize threats](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf) and how to reduce attack surface against them.\n\n* Keep the system up to date\n\t* Patch the base operating system and all third party software.\n\t* macOS system updates can be completed using the App Store application, or the `softwareupdate` command-line utility - neither requires registering an Apple account. Updates can also be downloaded directly from Apple's support site.\n\t* Subscribe to announcement mailing lists like [Apple security-announce](https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce).\n\n* Encrypt sensitive data at rest\n\t* In addition to full disk encryption, consider creating one or several encrypted partitions or volumes to store passwords, cryptographic keys, personal documents, etc. at rest.\n\t* This will mitigate damage in case of compromise and data theft.\n\n* Assure data availability\n\t* Create [regular backups](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596102461/backupcentral) of your data and be ready to format and re-install the operating system in case of compromise.\n\t* Always encrypt locally before copying backups to external media or the \"cloud\".\n\t* Verify backups work by testing them regularly, for example by accessing certain files or performing a hash based comparison.\n\n* Click carefully\n\t* Ultimately, the security of a system can be reduced to its administrator.\n\t* Care should be taken when installing new software. Always prefer [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and open source software ([which macOS is not](https://superuser.com/questions/19492/is-mac-os-x-open-source)).\n\n## Preparing and installing macOS\n\nThere are several ways to install macOS.\n\nThe simplest way is to boot into [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) by holding `Command` and `R` keys at boot. A system image can be downloaded and applied directly from Apple. However, this way exposes the serial number and other identifying information over the network in plain text, which may not be desired for privacy reasons.\n\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"PII is transmitted to Apple in plain text when using macOS Recovery\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12475110/20312189/8987c958-ab20-11e6-90fa-7fd7c8c1169e.png\">\n\n*Packet capture of an unencrypted HTTP conversation during macOS recovery*\n\nAn alternative way to install macOS is to first download the latest version of macOS (**Latest: macOS Monterey**) from Apple via the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-monterey/id1576738294) and create a custom installable system image.\n\n### Getting macOS\n\nApple's [documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683) provides details for getting older versions of macOS.\n\n* macOS Monterey (12): [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-monterey/id1576738294)\n* macOS Big Sur (11): [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132)\n* macOS Catalina (10.15): [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314)\n* macOS Mojave (10.14): [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828)\n* macOS High Sierra (10.13): [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741)\n* macOS Sierra (10.12): [Direct Link](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-39476-20191023-48f365f4-0015-4c41-9f44-39d3d2aca067/InstallOS.dmg) (HTTP)\n* OS X El Capitan (10.11): [Direct Link](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41424-20191024-218af9ec-cf50-4516-9011-228c78eda3d2/InstallMacOSX.dmg) (HTTP)\n* OS X Yosemite (10.10): [Direct Link](http://updates-http.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-41343-20191023-02465f92-3ab5-4c92-bfe2-b725447a070d/InstallMacOSX.dmg) (HTTP)\n\n### Verifying installation integrity\n\nThe macOS installation application is [code signed](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW6), which should be verified to make sure you received a legitimate copy, using the `pkgutil --check-signature` or `codesign -dvv` commands.\n\nTo verify the code signature and integrity of macOS application bundles:\n\n```console\n$ pkgutil --check-signature /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Monterey.app\nPackage \"Install macOS Monterey\":\n   Status: signed by a certificate trusted by macOS\n   Certificate Chain:\n    1.

See [Create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372), or run the utility without arguments to see how it works.\n\nTo create a **bootable USB installer**, mount a USB drive, and erase and partition it, then use the `createinstallmedia` utility:\n\n```console\n$ diskutil list\n[Find disk matching correct size, usually the last disk, e.g. /dev/disk2]\n\n$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\n\n$ diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 JHFS+ Installer 100%\n\n$ cd /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Monterey.app\n\n$ sudo ./Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Installer --nointeraction\nErasing disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 100%\nCopying to disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 40%... 50%... 60%... 70%... 80%... 90%... 100%\nMaking disk bootable...\nCopying boot files...\nInstall media now available at \"/Volumes/Install macOS Catalina\"\n```\n\nApple also has [guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/erase-and-reformat-a-storage-device-dskutl14079/mac) on doing this via the GUI Disk Utility\n\n### Creating an install image\n\n**Note** Apple's AutoDMG installer [does not appear to work](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/120) across OS versions. If you want to build a 10.14 image, for example, the following steps must be performed on macOS 10.14!\n\nTo create a **custom install image** which can be [restored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Software_Restore) to a Mac (using a USB-C cable and target disk mode, for example), use [MagerValp/AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG).\n\n#### Manual way\n\n**Note** The following instructions appear to work only on macOS versions before 10.13.\n\nFind `InstallESD.dmg` which is inside the installation application. Locate it in Terminal or with Finder, right click on the application bundle, select **Show Package Contents** and navigate to **Contents** > **SharedSupport** to find the file `InstallESD.dmg`\n\n[Verify](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201259) file integrity by comparing its SHA-256 hash with others found in [InstallESD_Hashes.csv](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/InstallESD_Hashes.csv) or [notpeter/apple-installer-checksums](https://github.com/notpeter/apple-installer-checksums).\n\nTo determine which macOS versions and builds originally shipped with or are available for a Mac, see [HT204319](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204319).\n\n```console\n$ shasum -a 256 InstallESD.dmg\n```\n\nMount and install the operating system to a temporary image:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil attach -mountpoint /tmp/InstallESD ./InstallESD.dmg\n\n$ hdiutil create -size 32g -type SPARSE -fs HFS+J -volname \"macOS\" -uid 0 -gid 80 -mode 1775 /tmp/macos.sparseimage\n\n$ hdiutil attach -mountpoint /tmp/macos -owners on /tmp/macos.sparseimage\n\n$ sudo installer -pkg /tmp/InstallESD/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg -tgt /tmp/macos -verbose\ninstaller: OS Install started.\n#############\n[...]\n```\n\nThe installation will take a while, so be patient. Use `tail -F /var/log/install.log` in another terminal to monitor progress and check for errors.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, detach, convert and verify the image:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil detach /tmp/macos\n\"disk4\" unmounted.\n\"disk4\" ejected.\n\n$ hdiutil detach /tmp/InstallESD\n\"disk3\" unmounted.\n\"disk3\" ejected.\n\n$ hdiutil convert -format UDZO /tmp/macos.sparseimage -o ~/sierra.dmg\nPreparing imaging engine...\n[...]\n\n$ asr imagescan --source ~/sierra.dmg\n```\n\nThe file `sierra.dmg` is now ready to be applied over [Target Disk Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462), from a bootable USB installer, booting from the network or recovery mode. The image could be further customized to include provisioned users, installed applications, preferences, for example.\n\n### Target disk mode\n\nTo use **Target Disk Mode**, boot up the Mac you wish to image while holding the `T` key and connect it to another Mac using a USB-C, Thunderbolt or Firewire cable.\n\nIf you don't have another Mac, boot to a USB installer, with `sierra.dmg` and other required files copied to it, by holding the *Option* key at boot.\n\nUse the command `diskutil list` to identify the disk of the connected Mac, usually `/dev/disk2`\n\nOptionally, [securely erase](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/securely-erase-mac-ssd/) the disk with a single pass (if previously FileVault-encrypted, the disk must first be unlocked and mounted as `/dev/disk3s2`):\n\n    $ sudo diskutil secureErase freespace 1 /dev/disk3s2\n\nPartition the disk to Journaled HFS+:\n\n```console\n$ sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2\n\n$ sudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 JHFS+ macOS 100%\n```\n\nRestore the image to the new volume, making sure `/dev/disk2` is the disk being erased:\n\n```console\n$ sudo asr restore --source ~/sierra.dmg --target /Volumes/macOS --erase --buffersize 4m\n[...]\nErase contents of /dev/disk2s2 (/Volumes/macOS)? [ny]:y\n[...]\n```\n\nThe **Disk Utility** application may also be used to erase the connected disk and restore `sierra.dmg` to the newly created partition.\n\nTo transfer any files, copy them to a shared folder like `/Users/Shared` on the mounted disk image, e.g. `cp Xcode_8.0.dmg /Volumes/macOS/Users/Shared`\n\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"Finished restore install from USB recovery boot\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12475110/14804078/f27293c8-0b2d-11e6-8e1f-0fb0ac2f1a4d.png\">\n\n*Finished restore install from USB recovery boot*\n\n### Creating a recovery partition\n\n**Unless** you have built the image with [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG), or installed macOS to a second partition on the same Mac, you will need to create a recovery partition in order to use full disk encryption. You can do so using [MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer](https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer) or manually by following these steps:\n\nDownload [RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg](https://support.apple.com/downloads/DL1464/en_US/RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg) and verify its integrity:\n\n```console\n$ shasum -a 256 RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg\nf6a4f8ac25eaa6163aa33ac46d40f223f40e58ec0b6b9bf6ad96bdbfc771e12c  RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg\n```\n\nAttach and expand the installer, then run it - again ensuring `/Volumes/macOS` path is the newly created partition on the connected disk:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil attach RecoveryHDUpdate.dmg\n\n$ pkgutil --expand /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Lion\\ Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg /tmp/recovery\n\n$ hdiutil attach /tmp/recovery/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg/RecoveryHDMeta.dmg\n\n$ /tmp/recovery/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg/Scripts/Tools/dmtest ensureRecoveryPartition /Volumes/macOS/ /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/BaseSystem.dmg 0 0 /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD\\ Update/BaseSystem.chunklist\n[...]\nCreating recovery partition: finished\n```\n\nRun `diskutil list` again to make sure `Recovery HD` now exists on `/dev/disk2`. Eject the disk with `hdiutil unmount /Volumes/macOS` and power down the target disk mode-booted Mac.\n\n### Virtualization\n\nTo install macOS as a virtual machine (VM) using [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html), follow the instructions above to create an image. You will **not** need to download and create a recovery partition manually.\n\nFor the Installation Method, select *Install macOS from the recovery partition*. Customize any memory or CPU requirements and complete setup. The guest VM should boot into [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) by default.\n\n**Note** If the virtual machine does not boot due to a kernel panic, adjust the memory and process resource settings.\n\nIn Recovery Mode, select a language, then select Utilities > Terminal from the menu bar.\n\nIn the guest VM, type `ifconfig | grep inet` - you should see a private address like `172.16.34.129`\n\nOn the host Mac, type `ifconfig | grep inet` - you should see a private gateway address like `172.16.34.1`. From the host Mac, you should be able to `ping 172.16.34.129` or the equivalent guest VM address.\n\nFrom the host Mac, serve the installable image to the guest VM by editing `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` and adding the following line to the top (using the gateway address assigned to the host Mac and port 80):\n\n    Listen 172.16.34.1:80\n\nOn the host Mac, link the image to the default Apache Web server directory:\n\n\t$ sudo ln ~/sierra.dmg /Library/WebServer/Documents\n\nFrom the host Mac, start Apache in the foreground:\n\n\t$ sudo httpd -X\n\nFrom the guest VM, install the disk image to the volume over the local network using `asr`:\n\n```console\n-bash-3.2# asr restore --source http://172.16.34.1/sierra.dmg --target /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/ --erase --buffersize 4m\n\tValidating target...done\n\tValidating source...done\n\tErase contents of /dev/disk0s2 (/Volumes/Macintosh HD)?

However, [late 2016 MacBooks](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Pro_15%22_Late_2016_Touch_Bar) with Touch Bar hardware [require online OS activation](https://onemoreadmin.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/the-untouchables-apples-new-os-activation-for-touch-bar-macbook-pros/) (also see next section).\n\nOn first boot, hold `Command` `Option` `P` `R` keys to [clear NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063).\n\nWhen macOS first starts, you'll be greeted by **Setup Assistant**.\n\nWhen creating the first account, use a [strong password](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength) without a hint.\n\nIf you enter your real name at the account setup process, be aware that your [computer's name and local hostname](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18720) will comprise that name (e.g., *John Appleseed's MacBook*) and thus will appear on local networks and in various preference files.\n\nBoth should be verified and updated as needed in **System Preferences > Sharing** or with the following commands after installation:\n\n\t$ sudo scutil --set ComputerName MacBook\n\t$ sudo scutil --set LocalHostName MacBook\n\n## System activation\n\nA few words on the privacy implications of activating \"Touch Bar\" MacBook devices from your friendly anonymous security researcher:\n\n> Apple increasingly seems (despite vague claims to the contrary) increasingly interested in merging or \"unifying\" the two OSes, and there are constantly rumors of fundamental changes to macOS that make it far more like iOS than the macOS of old. Apple's introduction of ARM-based coprocessors running iOS/sepOS, first with the T1 processor on the TouchBar MacBook Pros (run the TouchBar, implement NFC/ApplePay, add biometric login using sep, and verify firmware integrity) and the iMac Pro's T2 (implements/verifies embedded device firmware, implements secure boot, etc) seems to cement this concern and basically renders using macOS devices without sending metadata to Apple difficult to impossible.\n>\n> iOS devices have always required \"activation\" on first boot and when the battery has gone dead which initializes sepOS to proceed with verified boot. First boot activation not only initializes sepOS as discussed below, but sends metadata to Apple (and carriers via Apple with cellular devices) to activate the baseband and SIM. In activation processes after first boot, just as with first boot, a long list of highly sensitive metadata are sent hashed (note hashing does not give you any privacy from Apple here since they link this exact metadata to payment information at purchase) to Apple so it can return the personalized response required for secure boot to complete. What is particularly worrying about this process is that it is a network-linked secure boot process where centralized external servers have the power to dictate what the device should boot. Equally there are significant privacy concerns with devices constantly sending metadata (both during activation and other Apple-linked/-hosted activities) and linking IP addresses very strongly with real identities based on purchase payment information and if a cellular device, metadata collected about SIM, etc unless such connections are blocked at the network level (which is only possible on self-managed infrastructure, i.e. not cellular) and doing this basically renders using the device impossible since simply installing an application requires sending device metadata to Apple.\n>\n> That the activation verification mechanism is designed specifically to rely on unique device identifiers that are associated with payment information at purchase and actively associated on a continuing basis by Apple for every Apple-hosted service that the device interacts with (Apple ID-based services, softwareupdate, iMessage, FaceTime, etc.) the ability (and invitation) for Apple to silently send targeted malicious updates to devices matching specific unique ID criteria is a valid concern, and something that should not be dismissed as unlikely, especially given Apple's full compliance with recently implemented Chinese (and other authoritarian and \"non-authoritarian\" countries') national security laws.\n>\n> iOS has from the start been designed with very little end-user control with no way for end-users to configure devices according to their wishes while maintaining security and relies heavily on new, closed source code. While macOS has for most of its history been designed on the surface in a similar fashion, power and enterprise users can (for the moment) still configure their devices relatively securely while maintaining basically zero network interaction with Apple and with the installation of third party software/kernel extensions, completely control the network stack and intercept filesystem events on a per-process basis. macOS, despite having a good deal of closed source code, was designed at a very different period in Apple's history and was designed more in line with open source standards, and designed to be configurable and controllable by enterprise/power users.\n>\n> The introduction of these coprocessors to Mac devices, while increasing security in many ways, brings with it all the issues with iOS discussed above, and means that running mac devices securely with complete user control, and without forced network interaction with the Apple mothership in highly sensitive corporate and other environments problematic and risky. Given this author is unaware of the exact hardware configuration of the coprocessors, the following may be inaccurate. However, given the low-level nature of these coprocessors, it would not surprise the author if these coprocessors, if not already, will eventually have separate network access of their own, independent of the Intel CPU (indications suggest not currently the case for T1; unclear on T2), which leads to concerns similar to those that many have raised around Intel ME/AMT (and of course mac devices also have ME in the Intel CPU...). One could argue that these coprocessors increase security, and in many ways that is the case, but not the user's security against a malicious Apple.\n>\n> The lack of configurability is the key issue. Apple could have introduced secure boot and firmware protection without making it require network access, without making verification linked to device-unique IDs and without introducing an enormous amount of potentially exploitable code to protect against a much smaller, but highly exploitable codebase, while running on a coprocessor with a highly privileged position on the board which gives immense power to an adversary with manufacturer compliance for targeted attacks.\n>\n> This is an ongoing concern and in the worst case scenario could potentially represent the end of macs as independent, end-user controllable and relatively secure systems appropriate for sensitive environments with strict network and security policies.\n\nFrom [iOS, The Future Of macOS, Freedom, Security And Privacy In An Increasingly Hostile Global Environment](https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d).\n\n## Admin and standard user accounts\n\nThe first user account is always an admin account. Admin accounts are members of the admin group and have access to `sudo`, which allows them to usurp other accounts, in particular root, and gives them effective control over the system. Any program that the admin executes can potentially obtain the same access, making this a security risk.\n\nUtilities like `sudo` have [weaknesses that can be exploited](https://bogner.sh/2014/03/another-mac-os-x-sudo-password-bypass/) by concurrently running programs and many panes in System Preferences are [unlocked by default](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-179/sp800_179_draft.pdf) (pdf) (p. 61–62) for admin accounts.\n\nIt is considered a best practice by [Apple](https://help.apple.com/machelp/mac/10.12/index.html#/mh11389) and [others](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-179/sp800_179_draft.pdf) (pdf) (p. 41–42) to use a separate standard account for day-to-day work and use the admin account for installations and system configuration.\n\nIt is not strictly required to ever log into the admin account via the macOS login screen. The system will prompt for authentication when required and Terminal can do the rest. To that end, Apple provides some [recommendations](https://support.apple.com/HT203998) for hiding the admin account and its home directory. This can be an elegant solution to avoid having a visible 'ghost' account. The admin account can also be [removed from FileVault](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/94373) for additional hardening.\n\n### Caveats\n\n* Only administrators can install applications in `/Applications` (local directory). Finder and Installer will prompt a standard user with an authentication dialog. Many applications can be installed in `~/Applications` instead (the directory can be created manually). As a rule of thumb: applications that do not require admin access – or do not complain about not being installed in `/Applications` – should be installed in the user directory, the rest in the local directory. Mac App Store applications are still installed in `/Applications` and require no additional authentication.\n* `sudo` is not available in shells of the standard user, which requires using `su` or `login` to enter a shell of the admin account. This can make some maneuvers trickier and requires some basic experience with command-line interfaces.\n* System Preferences and several system utilities (e.g. Wi-Fi Diagnostics) will require root privileges for full functionality. Many panels in System Preferences are locked and need to be unlocked separately by clicking on the lock icon. Some applications will simply prompt for authentication upon opening, others must be opened by an admin account directly to get access to all functions (e.g. Console).\n* There are third-party applications that will not work correctly because they assume that the user account is an admin. These programs may have to be executed by logging into the admin account, or by using the `open` utility.\n* See additional discussion in [issue #167](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/167).\n\n### Setup\n\nAccounts can be created and managed in System Preferences. On settled systems, it is generally easier to create a second admin account and then demote the first account. This avoids data migration. Newly installed systems can also just add a standard account.\n\nDemoting an account can be done either from the the new admin account in System Preferences – the other account must be logged out – or by executing these commands (it may not be necessary to execute both, see [issue #179](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/179)):\n\n```console\n$ sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/admin GroupMembership <username>\n$ sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/admin GroupMembers <GeneratedUID>\n```\n\nTo find the “GeneratedUID” of an account:\n\n```console\n$ dscl . -read /Users/<username> GeneratedUID\n```\n\nSee also [this post](https://superuser.com/a/395738) for more information about how macOS determines group membership.\n\n## Full disk encryption\n\n[FileVault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault) provides full disk (technically, full _volume_) encryption on macOS.\n\nFileVault encryption protects data at rest and hardens (but [not always prevents](https://blog.frizk.net/2016/12/filevault-password-retrieval.html)) someone with physical access from stealing data or tampering with your Mac.\n\nWith much of the cryptographic operations happening [efficiently in hardware](https://web.archive.org/web/20180720195105/https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/d/4/1/d/8/AES_WP_Rev_03_Final_2010_01_26.pdf), the performance penalty for FileVault is not noticeable.\n\nLike all cryptosystems, the security of FileVault greatly depends on the quality of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG).\n\n> The random device implements the Yarrow pseudo random number generator algorithm and maintains its entropy pool.  Additional entropy is fed to the generator regularly by the SecurityServer daemon from random jitter measurements of the kernel.\n\nSee `man 4 random` for more information.\n\nTurning on FileVault in System Preferences **after** installing macOS, rather than creating an encrypted partition for the installation first, is [more secure](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/230), because more PRNG entropy is available then.\n\nAdditionally, the PRNG can be manually seeded with entropy by writing to /dev/random **before** enabling FileVault. This can be done by simply using the Mac for a little while before activating FileVault.\n\nIt may also be possible to increase entropy with an external source, like [OneRNG](http://onerng.info/). See [Entropy and Random Number Generators](https://calomel.org/entropy_random_number_generators.html) and [Fun with encryption and randomness](https://rsmith.home.xs4all.nl/howto/fun-with-encryption-and-randomness.html) for more information.\n\nEnable FileVault with `sudo fdesetup enable` or through **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** and reboot.\n\nIf you can remember the password, there's no reason to save the **recovery key**. However, all encrypted data will be lost forever if without either the password or recovery key.\n\nTo learn about how FileVault works, see the paper [Infiltrate the Vault: Security Analysis and Decryption of Lion Full Disk Encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/374.pdf) (pdf) and related [presentation](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~osc22/docs/slides_fv2_ifip_2013.pdf) (pdf). Also see [IEEE Std 1619-2007: The XTS-AES Tweakable Block Cipher](http://libeccio.di.unisa.it/Crypto14/Lab/p1619.pdf) (pdf).\n\n**Optional** Enforce system hibernation and evict FileVault keys from memory instead of traditional sleep to memory:\n\n```console\n$ sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1\n$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n```\n\n> All computers have firmware of some type - EFI, BIOS - to help in the discovery of hardware components and ultimately to properly bootstrap the computer using the desired OS instance. In the case of Apple hardware and the use of EFI, Apple stores relevant information within EFI to aid in the functionality of macOS. For example, the FileVault key is stored in EFI to transparently come out of standby mode.\n\n> Organizations especially sensitive to a high-attack environment, or potentially exposed to full device access when the device is in standby mode, should mitigate this risk by destroying the FileVault key in firmware. Doing so doesn't destroy the use of FileVault, but simply requires the user to enter the password in order for the system to come out of standby mode.\n\nIf you choose to evict FileVault keys in standby mode, you should also modify your standby and power nap settings. Otherwise, your machine may wake while in standby mode and then power off due to the absence of the FileVault key. See [issue #124](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/124) for more information. These settings can be changed with:\n\n```console\n$ sudo pmset -a powernap 0\n$ sudo pmset -a standby 0\n$ sudo pmset -a standbydelay 0\n$ sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Best Practices for\nDeploying FileVault 2](https://training.apple.com/pdf/WP_FileVault2.pdf) (pdf) and paper [Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/halderman/halderman.pdf) (pdf)\n\n**Note** APFS may make evicting FileVault keys redundant - see discussion and links in [issue #283](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/283).\n\n## Firmware\n\nSetting a firmware password prevents a Mac from starting up from any device other than the startup disk. It may also be set to be required on each boot. This may be useful for mitigating some attacks which require physical access to hardware.  See [How to set a firmware password on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204455) for official documentation.\n\nThis feature [can be helpful if your laptop is lost or stolen](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2015/08/virtues-strong-enduser-device-controls), protects against Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks which can read your FileVault passwords and inject kernel modules such as [pcileech](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech), as the only way to reset the firmware password is through an Apple Store, or by using an [SPI programmer](https://reverse.put.as/2016/06/25/apple-efi-firmware-passwords-and-the-scbo-myth/), such as [Bus Pirate](http://ho.ax/posts/2012/06/unbricking-a-macbook/) or other flash IC programmer.\n\n1. Start up pressing `Command` and `R` keys to boot to [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201314) mode.\n1. When the Recovery window appears, choose **Firmware Password Utility** from the Utilities menu.\n1. In the Firmware Utility window that appears, select **Turn On Firmware Password**.\n1. Enter a new password, then enter the same password in the **Verify** field.\n1. Select **Set Password**.\n1. Select **Quit Firmware Utility** to close the Firmware Password Utility.\n1. Select Restart or Shutdown from the Apple menu in the top-left corner.\n\nThe firmware password will activate at next boot. To validate the password, hold `Alt` during boot - you should be prompted to enter the password.\n\nThe firmware password can also be managed with the `firmwarepasswd` utility while booted into the OS. For example, to prompt for the firmware password when attempting to boot from a different volume:\n\n```console\n$ sudo firmwarepasswd -setpasswd -setmode command\n```\n\nTo verify the firmware password:\n\n```console\n$ sudo firmwarepasswd -verify\nVerifying Firmware Password\nEnter password:\nCorrect\n```\n\nA firmware password may be bypassed by a determined attacker or Apple, with physical access to the computer.\n\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"Using a Dediprog SF600 to dump and flash a 2013 MacBook SPI Flash chip to remove a firmware password, sans Apple\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12475110/17075918/0f851c0c-50e7-11e6-904d-0b56cf0080c1.png\">\n\n*Using a [Dediprog SF600](http://www.dediprog.com/pd/spi-flash-solution/sf600) to dump and flash a 2013 MacBook SPI Flash chip to remove a firmware password, sans Apple*\n\nAs of macOS 10.15 Catalina, the `firmwarepasswd` program has a new option `-disable-reset-capability`. According to [Apple's new Platform Security page](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec28382c9ca/web), this effectively prevents any firmware password resets, even by Apple themselves:\n\n> For users who want no one but themselves to remove their Firmware Password by software means, the -disable-reset-capability option has been added to the firmwarepasswd command-line tool in macOS 10.15. Before setting this option, users must to acknowledge that if the password is forgotten and needs removal, the user must bear the cost of the motherboard replacement necessary to achieve this.\n\nNewer Mac models (Mac Pro, iMac Pro, Macbook with TouchBar) with [Apple T2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple-designed_processors#Apple_T2) chips, which provide a secure enclave for encrypted keys, lessen the risk of EFI firmware attacks. See [this blog post](http://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/) for more information.\n\nSee [LongSoft/UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool), [chipsec/chipsec](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec) and discussion in [issue #213](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/213) for more information.\n\n## Firewall\n\nThere are several types of firewalls available for macOS.\n\n### Application layer firewall\n\nBuilt-in, basic firewall which blocks **incoming** connections only. This firewall does not have the ability to monitor, nor block **outgoing** connections.\n\nIt can be controlled by the **Firewall** tab of **Security & Privacy** in **System Preferences**, or with the following commands.\n\nEnable the firewall with logging and stealth mode:\n\n```console\n$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on\nFirewall is enabled. (State = 1)\n\n$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setloggingmode on\nTurning on log mode\n\n$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on\nStealth mode enabled\n```\n\n> Computer hackers scan networks so they can attempt to identify computers to attack. You can prevent your computer from responding to some of these scans by using **stealth mode**. When stealth mode is enabled, your computer does not respond to ICMP ping requests, and does not answer to connection attempts from a closed TCP or UDP port. This makes it more difficult for attackers to find your computer.\n\nTo prevent *built-in software* as well as *code-signed, downloaded software from being whitelisted automatically*:\n\n```console\n$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setallowsigned off\nDisabled allow signed built-in applications automatically\n\n$ sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setallowsignedapp off\nDisabled allow signed downloaded applications automatically\n```\n\n> Applications that are signed by a valid certificate authority are automatically added to the list of allowed apps, rather than prompting the user to authorize them. Apps included in macOS are signed by Apple and are allowed to receive incoming connections when this setting is enabled. For example, since iTunes is already signed by Apple, it is automatically allowed to receive incoming connections through the firewall.\n\n> If you run an unsigned app that is not listed in the firewall list, a dialog appears with options to Allow or Deny connections for the app. If you choose \"Allow\", macOS signs the application and automatically adds it to the firewall list. If you choose \"Deny\", macOS adds it to the list but denies incoming connections intended for this app.\n\nAfter interacting with `socketfilterfw`, restart the process by sending a line hangup signal:\n\n```console\n$ sudo pkill -HUP socketfilterfw\n```\n\n### Third party firewalls\n\nPrograms such as [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html), [Hands Off](https://www.oneperiodic.com/products/handsoff/), [Radio Silence](https://radiosilenceapp.com/), [LuLu](https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html) and [Security Growler](https://pirate.github.io/security-growler/) provide a good balance of usability and security.\n\nThese programs are capable of monitoring and blocking **incoming** and **outgoing** network connections. However, they may require the use of a closed source [kernel extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html).\n\nIf the number of choices of allowing/blocking network connections is overwhelming, use **Silent Mode** with connections allowed, then periodically check the configuration to gain understanding of applications and what they are doing.\n\nIt is worth noting that these firewalls can be bypassed by programs running as **root** or through [OS vulnerabilities](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Wardle-Writing-Bad-A-Malware-For-OS-X.pdf) (pdf), but they are still worth having - just don't expect absolute protection. However, some malware actually [deletes itself](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-remove-the-flashback-malware-from-os-x/) and doesn't execute if Little Snitch, or other security software, is installed.\n\nFor more on how Little Snitch works, see the [Network Kernel Extensions Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/NKEConceptual/socket_nke/socket_nke.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001858-CH228-SW1) and [Shut up snitch! – reverse engineering and exploiting a critical Little Snitch vulnerability](https://reverse.put.as/2016/07/22/shut-up-snitch-reverse-engineering-and-exploiting-a-critical-little-snitch-vulnerability/).\n\n### Kernel level packet filtering\n\nA highly customizable, powerful, but also most complicated firewall exists in the kernel. It can be controlled with `pfctl` and various configuration files.\n\npf can also be controlled with a GUI application such as [IceFloor](http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/) or [Murus](https://www.murusfirewall.com/).\n\nThere are many books and articles on the subject of pf firewall. Here's is just one example of blocking traffic by IP address.\n\nAdd the following into a file called `pf.rules`:\n\n```\nwifi = \"en0\"\nether = \"en7\"\nset block-policy drop\nset fingerprints \"/etc/pf.os\"\nset ruleset-optimization basic\nset skip on lo0\nscrub in all no-df\ntable <blocklist> persist\nblock in log\nblock in log quick from no-route to any\nblock log on $wifi from { <blocklist> } to any\nblock log on $wifi from any to { <blocklist> }\nantispoof quick for { $wifi $ether }\npass out proto tcp from { $wifi $ether } to any keep state\npass out proto udp from { $wifi $ether } to any keep state\npass out proto icmp from $wifi to any keep state\n```\n\nThen use the following commands to manipulate the firewall:\n\n* `sudo pfctl -e -f pf.rules` to enable the firewall and load the configuration\n* `sudo pfctl -d` to disable the firewall\n* `sudo pfctl -t blocklist -T add 1.2.3.4` to add an IP address to the blocklist\n* `sudo pfctl -t blocklist -T show` to view the blocklist\n* `sudo ifconfig pflog0 create` to create an interface for logging\n* `sudo tcpdump -ni pflog0` to view filtered packets\n\nUnless you're already familiar with packet filtering, spending too much time configuring pf is not recommended. It is also probably unnecessary if your Mac is behind a [NAT](https://www.grc.com/nat/nat.htm) on a secure home network.\n\nIt is possible to use the pf firewall to block network access to entire ranges of network addresses, for example to a whole organization:\n\nQuery [Merit RADb](http://www.radb.net/) for the list of networks in use by an autonomous system, like [Facebook](https://ipinfo.io/AS32934):\n\n```console\n$ whois -h whois.radb.net '!gAS32934'\n```\n\nCopy and paste the list of networks returned into the blocklist command:\n\n```console\n$ sudo pfctl -t blocklist -T add 31.13.24.0/21 31.13.64.0/24 157.240.0.0/16\n```\n\nConfirm the addresses were added:\n\n```console\n$ sudo pfctl -t blocklist -T show\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\n   31.13.24.0/21\n   31.13.64.0/24\n   157.240.0.0/16\n```\n\nConfirm network traffic is blocked to those addresses (note that DNS requests will still work):\n\n```console\n$ dig a +short facebook.com\n157.240.2.35\n\n$ curl --connect-timeout 5 -I http://facebook.com/\n*   Trying 157.240.2.35...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connection timed out after 5002 milliseconds\n* Closing connection 0\ncurl: (28) Connection timed out after 5002 milliseconds\n\n$ sudo tcpdump -tqni pflog0 'host 157.240.2.35'\nIP 192.168.1.1.62771 > 157.240.2.35.80: tcp 0\nIP 192.168.1.1.62771 > 157.240.2.35.80: tcp 0\nIP 192.168.1.1.62771 > 157.240.2.35.80: tcp 0\nIP 192.168.1.1.62771 > 157.240.2.35.80: tcp 0\nIP 192.168.1.1.162771 > 157.240.2.35.80: tcp 0\n```\n\nOutgoing TCP SYN packets are blocked, so a TCP connection is not established and thus a Web site is effectively blocked at the IP layer.\n\nTo use pf to audit \"phone home\" behavior of user and system-level processes, see [fix-macosx/net-monitor](https://github.com/fix-macosx/net-monitor).

Either temporarily disable SIP or disable services from Recovery Mode. See [Issue 334](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/334) for more information.\n\nSee [fix-macosx/yosemite-phone-home](https://github.com/fix-macosx/yosemite-phone-home), [l1k/osxparanoia](https://github.com/l1k/osxparanoia) and [karek314/macOS-home-call-drop](https://github.com/karek314/macOS-home-call-drop) for further recommendations.\n\nServices on macOS are managed by **launchd**. See [launchd.info](http://launchd.info/), as well as [Apple's Daemons and Services Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html) and [Technical Note TN2083](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html)\n\nYou can also run [KnockKnock](https://objective-see.com/products/knockknock.html) that shows more information about startup items.\n\n* Use `launchctl list` to view running user agents\n* Use `sudo launchctl list` to view running system daemons\n* Specify the service name to examine it, e.g. `launchctl list com.apple.Maps.mapspushd`\n* Use `defaults read` to examine job plists in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons` and `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`\n* Use `man` and `strings` to find out more about what an agent/daemon does\n\nFor example, to learn what a system launch daemon or agent does, start with:\n\n```console\n$ defaults read /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist\n```\n\nLook at the `Program` or `ProgramArguments` section to see which binary is run, in this case `apsd`. To find more information about that, look at the man page with `man apsd`\n\nFor example, if you're not interested in Apple Push Notifications, disable the service:\n\n```console\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist\n```\n\n**Note** Unloading services may break usability of some applications. Read the manual pages and use Google to make sure you understand what you're doing first.\n\nBe careful about disabling any system daemons you don't understand, as it may render your system unbootable. If you break your Mac, use [single user mode](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/start-up-your-mac-in-single-user-mode-mchlp1720/mac) to fix it.\n\nUse [Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_macOS_components#Console) and [Activity Monitor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464) applications if you notice your Mac heating up, feeling sluggish, or generally misbehaving, as it may have resulted from your tinkering.\n\nTo view the status of services:\n\n```console\n$ find /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/ -type f -print -exec defaults read {} \\; 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nAnnotated lists of launch daemons and agents, the respective program executed, and the programs' hash sums are included in this repository.\n\n**(Optional)** Run the `read_launch_plists.py` script and `diff` output to check for any discrepancies on your system, e.g.:\n\n```console\n$ diff <(python read_launch_plists.py | sort ) <(cat 16A323_launchd.csv | sort )\n```\n\nSee also [cirrusj.github.io/Yosemite-Stop-Launch](https://cirrusj.github.io/Yosemite-Stop-Launch/) for descriptions of services and [Provisioning OS X and Disabling Unnecessary Services](https://vilimpoc.org/blog/2014/01/15/provisioning-os-x-and-disabling-unnecessary-services/) for another explanation.\n\nPersistent login items may also exist in these directories:\n\n* `/Library/LaunchAgents`\n* `/Library/LaunchDaemons`\n* `/Library/ScriptingAdditions`\n* `/Library/StartupItems`\n* `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`\n* `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`\n* `/System/Library/ScriptingAdditions`\n* `/System/Library/StartupItems`\n* `~/Library/LaunchAgents`\n* `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist`\n\nSee [Mac OSX Startup](http://www.malicious-streams.com/article/Mac_OSX_Startup.pdf) (pdf) for more information.\n\n## Spotlight Suggestions\n\nDisable **Spotlight Suggestions** in both the Spotlight preferences and Safari's Search preferences to avoid your search queries being sent to Apple.\n\nAlso disable **Bing Web Searches** in the Spotlight preferences to avoid your search queries being sent to Microsoft.\n\nSee [fix-macosx.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180817061520/https://fix-macosx.com/) for detailed instructions.\n\n> If you've upgraded to OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\" and you're using the default settings, each time you start typing in Spotlight (to open an application or search for a file on your computer), your local search terms and location are sent to Apple and third parties (including Microsoft).\n\n **Note** This Web site and instructions may no longer work on macOS Sierra - see [issue 164](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/164).\n\nFor comparison to Windows 10, see <https://fix10.isleaked.com/>\n\n## Homebrew\n\nConsider using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to make software installations easier and to update userland tools (see [Apple's great GPL purge](http://meta.ath0.com/2012/02/05/apples-great-gpl-purge/)).\n\n**Note** If you have not already installed Xcode or Command Line Tools, use `xcode-select --install` to download and install them, or check Apple's developer site.\n\n[Install Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Installation.md#installation):\n\n```console\n$ mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew\n```\n\nEdit `PATH` in your shell or shell rc file to use `~/homebrew/bin` and `~/homebrew/sbin`. For example, `echo 'PATH=$PATH:~/homebrew/sbin:~/homebrew/bin' >> .zshrc`, then change your login shell to Z shell with `chsh -s /bin/zsh`, open a new Terminal window and run `brew update`.\n\nHomebrew uses SSL/TLS to talk with GitHub and verifies integrity of downloaded packages, so it's [fairly secure](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/18036).\n\nRemember to periodically run `brew update` and `brew upgrade` on trusted and secure networks to download and install software updates. To get information on a package before installation, run `brew info <package>` and check its recipe online.\n\nAccording to [Homebrew's Anonymous Aggregate User Behaviour Analytics](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Analytics.md), Homebrew gathers anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics and reporting these to Google Analytics.\n\nTo opt out of Homebrew's analytics, you can set `export HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1` in your environment or shell rc file, or use `brew analytics off`.\n\nYou may also wish to enable [additional security options](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/138), such as `HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1` and `HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=--require-sha`.\n\n## DNS\n\n#### Hosts file\n\nUse the [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) to block known malware, advertising or otherwise unwanted domains.\n\nEdit the hosts file as root, for example with `sudo vi /etc/hosts`. The hosts file can also be managed with the GUI app [2ndalpha/gasmask](https://github.com/2ndalpha/gasmask).\n\nTo block a domain by `A` record, append any one of the following lines to `/etc/hosts`:\n\n```\n0 example.com\n0.0.0.0 example.com\n127.0.0.1 example.com\n```\n\n**Note** IPv6 uses the `AAAA` DNS record type, rather than `A` record type, so you may also want to block those connections by *also* including `::1 example.com` entries, like shown [here](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ipv6/).\n\nThere are many lists of domains available online which you can paste in, just make sure each line starts with `0`, `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`, and the line `127.0.0.1 localhost` is included.\n\nHere are some popular and useful hosts lists:\n\n* [jmdugan/blocklists](https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists)\n* [l1k/osxparanoia](https://github.com/l1k/osxparanoia/blob/master/hosts)\n* [Sinfonietta/hostfiles](https://github.com/Sinfonietta/hostfiles)\n* [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)\n* [someonewhocares.org](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/hosts)\n\nAppend a list of hosts with the `tee` command and confirm only non-routable addresses or comments were added:\n\n```console\n$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n\n$ wc -l /etc/hosts\n65580\n\n$ egrep -ve \"^#|^255.255.255.255|^127.|^0.|^::1|^ff..::|^fe80::\" /etc/hosts | sort | uniq | egrep -e \"[1,2]|::\"\n[No output]\n```\n\nSee `man hosts` and [FreeBSD Configuration Files](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/configtuning-configfiles.html) for more information.\n\nSee the [dnsmasq](#dnsmasq) section of this guide for more hosts blocking options.\n\n#### dnscrypt\n\nTo encrypt outgoing DNS traffic, consider using [jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy). In combination with dnsmasq and DNSSEC, the integrity and authenticity of DNS traffic is greatly improved.\n\n[JayBrown/DNSCrypt-Menu](https://github.com/JayBrown/DNSCrypt-Menu) and [jedisct1/bitbar-dnscrypt-proxy-switcher](https://github.com/jedisct1/bitbar-dnscrypt-proxy-switcher) provide a graphical user interface to dnscrypt.\n\nInstall dnscrypt from Homebrew and follow the instructions to configure and start `dnscrypt-proxy`:\n\n```console\n$ brew install dnscrypt-proxy\n```\n\nIf using in combination with Dnsmasq, find the file `homebrew.mxcl.dnscrypt-proxy.plist` by running\n\n```console\n$ brew info dnscrypt-proxy\n```\n\nwhich will show a location like `/usr/local/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`\n\nOpen it in a text editor, find the line starting with `listen_addresses =` and edit that line to use DNScrypt on a port other than 53, like 5355:\n\n```\nlisten_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:5355', '[::1]:5355']\n```\n\nStart DNSCrypt:\n\n```console\n$ sudo brew services restart dnscrypt-proxy\n```\n\nMake sure DNSCrypt is running:\n\n```console\n$ sudo lsof +c 15 -Pni UDP:5355\nCOMMAND          PID   USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\ndnscrypt-proxy 15244 nobody    7u  IPv4 0x1337f85ff9f8beef      0t0  UDP 127.0.0.1:5355\ndnscrypt-proxy 15244 nobody   10u  IPv6 0x1337f85ff9f8beef      0t0  UDP [::1]:5355\ndnscrypt-proxy 15244 nobody   12u  IPv4 0x1337f85ff9f8beef      0t0  UDP 127.0.0.1:5355\ndnscrypt-proxy 15244 nobody   14u  IPv6 0x1337f85ff9f8beef      0t0  UDP [::1]:5355\n```\n\n> By default, dnscrypt-proxy runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 53,\nand under the \"nobody\" user using the resolvers specified in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v2/public-resolvers.md. If you would like to change these settings, you will have to edit the configuration file (e.g. listen_addresses, user_name, urls, etc.)\n\nThis can be accomplished by editing `/usr/local/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` as described above.\n\nYou can run your own [dnscrypt server](https://github.com/Cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper) (see also [drduh/Debian-Privacy-Server-Guide#dnscrypt](https://github.com/drduh/Debian-Privacy-Server-Guide#dnscrypt)) from a trusted location or use one of many [public servers](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv) instead.\n\nConfirm outgoing DNS traffic is encrypted:\n\n```console\n$ sudo tcpdump -qtni en0\nIP 10.8.8.8.59636 > 107.181.168.52: UDP, length 512\nIP 107.181.168.52 > 10.8.8.8.59636: UDP, length 368\n\n$ dig +short -x 128.180.155.106.49321\nd0wn-us-ns4\n```\n\ndnscrypt-proxy also has the capability to blacklist domains, including the use of wild-cards. See the [Sample configuration file for dnscrypt-proxy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/master/dnscrypt-proxy.conf) for the options.\n\n**Note** Applications and programs may resolve DNS using their own provided servers. If dnscrypt-proxy is used, it is possible to disable all other, non-dnscrypt DNS traffic with the following pf rules:\n\n```shell\nblock drop quick on !lo0 proto udp from any to any port = 53\nblock drop quick on !lo0 proto tcp from any to any port = 53\n```\n\nSee also [What is a DNS leak](https://dnsleaktest.com/what-is-a-dns-leak.html), the [mDNSResponder manual page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/mDNSResponder.8.html) and [ipv6-test.com](http://ipv6-test.com/).\n\n#### Dnsmasq\n\nAmong other features, [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is able to cache replies, prevent upstream queries for unqualified names, and block entire top-level domain names.\n\nUse in combination with DNSCrypt to additionally encrypt outgoing DNS traffic.\n\nIf you don't wish to use DNSCrypt, you should at least use DNS [not provided](http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/ietf/verisign-abuse.html) [by your ISP](http://hackercodex.com/guide/how-to-stop-isp-dns-server-hijacking/). Two popular alternatives are [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) and [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/).\n\n**(Optional)** [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity. All answers from DNSSEC protected zones are digitally signed. The signed records are authenticated via a chain of trust, starting with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root-zone. The current root-zone trust anchors may be downloaded [from IANA website](https://www.iana.org/dnssec/files). There are a number of resources on DNSSEC, but probably the best one is [dnssec.net website](http://www.dnssec.net).\n\nInstall Dnsmasq (DNSSEC is optional):\n\n```console\n$ brew install dnsmasq --with-dnssec\n```\n\nDownload [drduh/config/dnsmasq.conf](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/dnsmasq.conf):\n\n```\n$ curl -o homebrew/etc/dnsmasq.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nEdit the file and examine all the options. To block entire levels of domains, append [drduh/config/domains](https://github.com/drduh/config/tree/master/domains) or your own rules.\n\nInstall and start the program (sudo is required to bind to [privileged port](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16564/why-are-the-first-1024-ports-restricted-to-the-root-user-only) 53):\n\n```console\n$ sudo brew services start dnsmasq\n```\n\nTo set Dnsmasq as your local DNS server, open **System Preferences** > **Network** and select the active interface, then the **DNS** tab, select **+** and add `127.0.0.1`, or use:\n\n```console\n$ sudo networksetup -setdnsservers \"Wi-Fi\" 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nMake sure Dnsmasq is correctly configured:\n\n```console\n$ scutil --dns | head\nDNS configuration\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : whatever\n  nameserver[0] : 127.0.0.1\n  flags    : Request A records, Request AAAA records\n  reach    : 0x00030002 (Reachable,Local Address,Directly Reachable Address)\n\n$ networksetup -getdnsservers \"Wi-Fi\"\n127.0.0.1\n```\n\n**Note** Some VPN software overrides DNS settings on connect. See [issue #24](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/24) and [drduh/config/scripts/macos-dns.sh](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/scripts/macos-dns.sh).\n\n##### Test DNSSEC validation\n\nTest DNSSEC validation succeeds for signed zones - the reply should have `NOERROR` status and contain `ad` flag:\n\n```console\n$ dig +dnssec icann.org\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 47039\n;; flags: qr rd ra ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n```\n\nTest DNSSEC validation fails for zones that are signed improperly - the reply should have `SERVFAIL` status:\n\n```console\n$ dig www.dnssec-failed.org\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 15190\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n```\n\n## Captive portal\n\nWhen macOS connects to new networks, it checks for Internet connectivity and may launch a Captive Portal assistant utility application.\n\nAn attacker could trigger the utility and direct a Mac to a site with malware without user interaction, so it's best to disable this feature and log in to captive portals using your regular Web browser by navigating to a non-secure HTTP page and accepting a redirect to the captive portal login interface (after disabling any custom proxy or DNS settings).\n\n```console\n$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control.plist Active -bool false\n```\n\nAlso see [Apple's secret \"wispr\" request](https://web.archive.org/web/20171008071031/http://blog.erratasec.com/2010/09/apples-secret-wispr-request.html), [How to disable the captive portal window in Mac OS Lion](https://web.archive.org/web/20130407200745/http://www.divertednetworks.net/apple-captiveportal.html) and [An undocumented change to Captive Network Assistant settings in OS X 10.10 Yosemite](https://web.archive.org/web/20170622064304/https://grpugh.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/an-undocumented-change-to-captive-network-assistant-settings-in-os-x-10-10-yosemite/).\n\n\n## Certificate authorities\n\nmacOS comes with [over 200](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202858) root authority certificates installed from for-profit corporations like Apple, Verisign, Thawte, Digicert and government agencies from China, Japan, Netherlands, U.S., and more! These Certificate Authorities (CAs) are capable of issuing SSL/TLS certificates for any domain, code signing certificates, etc.\n\nFor more information, see [Certification Authority Trust Tracker](https://github.com/kirei/catt), [Analysis of the HTTPS certificate ecosystem](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc257-durumericAemb.pdf) (pdf), and [You Won’t Be Needing These Any More: On Removing Unused Certificates From Trust Stores](https://www.ifca.ai/fc14/papers/fc14_submission_100.pdf) (pdf).\n\nInspect system root certificates in **Keychain Access**, under the **System Roots** tab or by using the `security` command line tool and `/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain` file.\n\nDisable certificate authorities through Keychain Access by marking them as **Never Trust** and closing the window:\n\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"A certificate authority certificate\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12475110/19222972/6b7aabac-8e32-11e6-8efe-5d3219575a98.png\">\n\nThe risk of a [man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack in which a coerced or compromised certificate authority trusted by your system issues a fake/rogue SSL certificate is quite low, but still [possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates).\n\n## OpenSSL\n\n**Note** This section [may be out of date](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/356).\n\nThe version of OpenSSL in Sierra is `0.9.8zh` which is [not current](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/200582/why-is-apple-using-an-older-version-of-openssl). It doesn't support TLS 1.1 or newer, elliptic curve ciphers, and [more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27502215/difference-between-openssl-09-8z-and-1-0-1).\n\nSince Apple's official supported TLS library on macOS is [Secure Transport](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secure_transport), OpenSSL **deprecated** is considered deprecated (according to the [Cryptographic Services Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html). Apple's version of OpenSSL may also have patches which may [surprise you](https://hynek.me/articles/apple-openssl-verification-surprises/).\n\nIf you're going to use OpenSSL on your Mac, download and install a recent version of OpenSSL with `brew install openssl`. Note, linking brew to be used in favor of `/usr/bin/openssl` may interfere with built-in software. See [issue #39](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/39).\n\nCompare the TLS protocol and cipher between the homebrew version and the system version of OpenSSL:\n\n```console\n$ ~/homebrew/bin/openssl version; echo | ~/homebrew/bin/openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 2>&1 | grep -A2 SSL-Session\nOpenSSL 1.0.2j  26 Sep 2016\nSSL-Session:\n    Protocol  : TLSv1.2\n    Cipher    : ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256\n\n$ /usr/bin/openssl version; echo | /usr/bin/openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 2>&1 | grep -A2 SSL-Session\nOpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016\nSSL-Session:\n    Protocol  : TLSv1\n    Cipher    : AES128-SHA\n```\n\nSee also [Comparison of TLS implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations), [How's My SSL](https://www.howsmyssl.com/) and [Qualys SSL Labs Tools](https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/).\n\n## Curl\n\nThe version of Curl which comes with macOS uses [Secure Transport](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Reference/secureTransportRef/) for SSL/TLS validation.\n\nIf you prefer to use OpenSSL, install with `brew install curl --with-openssl` and ensure it's the default with `brew link --force curl`\n\nDownload [drduh/config/curlrc](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/curlrc) or see the [man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html):\n\n```console\n$ curl -o ~/.curlrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/curlrc\n```\n\n## Web\n\n### Privoxy\n\nConsider using [Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/) as a local proxy to filter Web browsing traffic.\n\n**Note** macOS proxy settings are not universal; apps and services may not honor system proxy settings. Ensure the application you wish to proxy is correctly configured and manually verify connections don't leak. Additionally, it may be possible to configure the *pf* firewall to transparently proxy all traffic.\n\nA signed installation package for privoxy can be downloaded from [silvester.org.uk](https://silvester.org.uk/privoxy/Macintosh%20%28OS%20X%29/) or [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/files/Macintosh%20%28OS%20X%29/). The signed package is [more secure](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/65) than the Homebrew version, and attracts full support from the Privoxy project.\n\nAlternatively, install and start privoxy using Homebrew:\n\n```console\n$ brew install privoxy\n\n$ brew services start privoxy\n```\n\nBy default, privoxy listens on localhost, TCP port 8118.\n\nSet the system **HTTP** proxy for your active network interface `127.0.0.1` and `8118` (This can be done through **System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Proxies**):\n\n```console\n$ sudo networksetup -setwebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" 127.0.0.1 8118\n```\n\n**(Optional)** Set the system **HTTPS** proxy, which still allows for domain name filtering, with:\n\n```console\n$ sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" 127.0.0.1 8118\n```\n\nConfirm the proxy is set:\n\n```console\n$ scutil --proxy\n<dictionary> {\n  ExceptionsList : <array> {\n    0 : *.local\n    1 : 169.254/16\n  }\n  FTPPassive : 1\n  HTTPEnable : 1\n  HTTPPort : 8118\n  HTTPProxy : 127.0.0.1\n}\n```\n\nVisit <http://p.p/> in a browser, or with Curl:\n\n```console\n$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl -I http://p.p/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Length: 2401\nContent-Type: text/html\nCache-Control: no-cache\n```\n\nPrivoxy already comes with many good rules, however you can also write your own.\n\nDownload [drduh/config/privoxy/config](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/privoxy/config) and [drduh/config/privoxy/user.action](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/privoxy/user.action) to get started:\n\n```console\n$ curl -o homebrew/etc/privoxy/config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/privoxy/config\n\n$ curl -o homebrew/etc/privoxy/user.action https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/privoxy/user.action\n```\n\nRestart Privoxy and verify traffic is blocked or redirected:\n\n```console\n$ sudo brew services restart privoxy\n\n$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl ads.foo.com/ -IL\nHTTP/1.1 403 Request blocked by Privoxy\nContent-Type: image/gif\nContent-Length: 64\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl imgur.com/ -IL\nHTTP/1.1 302 Local Redirect from Privoxy\nLocation: https://imgur.com/\nContent-Length: 0\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n```\n\nYou can replace ad images with pictures of kittens, for example, by starting a local Web server and [redirecting blocked requests](https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER) to localhost.\n\n### Browser\n\nThe Web browser poses the largest security and privacy risk, as its fundamental job is to download and execute untrusted code from the Internet. This is an important statement. The unique use case of Web Browsers of operation in hostile environments, has forced them to adopt certain impressive security features. The cornerstone of Web Browser security is the Same Origin Policy ([SOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)). In a few words, SOP prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model (DOM). If SOP is compromised, the security of the whole Web Browser is compromised.\n\nThe best tip to ensure secure browsing regardless your choice of Web Browser is proper security hygiene. The majority of Web Browser exploits require social engineering attacks to achieve native code execution. Always be mindful of the links you click and be extra careful when websites ask you to download and install software. 99% percent of the time that software is malware.\n\nAnother important consideration about Web Browser security is Web Extensions. Web Extensions greatly increase the attack surface of the Web Browser. This is an issue that plagues Firefox and [Chrome](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2016/files/24.pdf) alike. Luckily, Web Extensions can only access specific browser APIs that are being governed by their manifest. That means we can quickly audit their behavior and remove them if they request access to information they shouldn't (why would an Ad blocker require camera access?). In the interest of security, it is best to limit your use of Web Extensions.\n\n[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) are covered in this guide. Each Web Browser offers certain benefits and drawbacks regarding their security and privacy. It is best to make an informed choice and not necessarily commit to only one.\n\n#### Firefox\n\n[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is an excellent browser as well as being completely open source. Currently, Firefox is in a renaissance period. It replaces major parts of its infrastructure and code base under projects [Quantum](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum) and [Photon](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Photon/Updates). Part of the Quantum project is to replace C++ code with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). Rust is a systems programming language with a focus on security and thread safety. It is expected that Rust adoption will greatly improve the overall security posture of Firefox.\n\nFirefox offers a similar security model to Chrome: it has a [bug bounty program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/), although it is not a lucrative as Chrome's. Firefox follows a six-week release cycle similar to Chrome. See discussion in issues [#2](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/2) and [#90](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/90) for more information about certain differences in Firefox and Chrome.\n\nFirefox supports user-supplied configuration files. See [drduh/config/user.js](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/user.js), [pyllyukko/user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js) and [ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) for recommended preferences and hardening measures. Also see [NoScript](https://noscript.net/), an extension which allows whitelist-based, pre-emptive script blocking.\n\nFirefox is focused on user privacy. It supports [tracking protection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Privacy/Tracking_Protection) in Private Browsing mode. The tracking protection can be enabled for the default account, although it may break the browsing experience on some websites. Another feature for added privacy unique to Firefox is [Containers](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers), similar to Chrome profiles.\n\nPrevious versions of Firefox used a [Web Extension SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Legacy_add_ons) that was quite invasive and offered immense freedom to developers. Sadly, that freedom also introduced a number of vulnerabilities in Firefox that greatly affected its users. You can find more information about vulnerabilities introduced by Firefox's legacy extensions in this [paper](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/24541.pdf) (pdf). Currently, Firefox only supports Web Extensions through the [Web Extension Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), which is very similar to Chrome's.\n\nSubmission of Web Extensions in Firefox is free. Web Extensions in Firefox most of the time are open source, although certain Web Extensions are proprietary.\n\n**Note** Similar to Chrome and Safari, Firefox allows account sync across multiple devices. While stored login passwords are encrypted, Firefox does not require a password to reveal their plain text format. Firefox only displays as yes/no prompt. This is an important security issue. Keep that in mind if you sign in to your Firefox account from devices that do not belong to you and leave them unattended. The [issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393493) has been raised among the Firefox community and hopefully will be resolved in the coming versions.\n\nSee [drduh/config/firefox.user.js](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/firefox.user.js) for additional Firefox configuration options to improve security and privacy.\n\n#### Chrome\n\n[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is based on the open source [Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/Home) with certain [proprietary components](https://fossbytes.com/difference-google-chrome-vs-chromium-browser/):\n\n* Automatic updates with GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon.\n* Usage tracking and crash reporting, which can be disabled through Chrome's settings.\n* Chrome Web Store.\n* Adobe Flash Plugin - supports a Pepper API version of Adobe Flash which gets updated automatically with Chrome.\n* Media Codec support - adds support for proprietary codecs.\n* Chrome [PDF viewer](http://0xdabbad00.com/2013/01/13/most-secure-pdf-viewer-chrome-pdf-viewer/).\n* Non-optional tracking. Google Chrome installer includes a randomly generated token. The token is sent to Google after the installation completes in order to measure the success rate. The RLZ identifier stores information – in the form of encoded strings – like the source of chrome download and installation week. It doesn’t include any personal information and it’s used to measure the effectiveness of a promotional campaign. **Chrome downloaded from Google’s website doesn’t have the RLZ identifier**. The source code to decode the strings is made open by Google.\n\nChrome offers account sync between multiple devices. Part of the sync data are stored website credentials. The login passwords are encrypted and in order to access them, a user's Google account password is required. You can use your Google account to sign to your Chrome customized settings from other devices while retaining your the security of your passwords.\n\nChrome's Web store for extensions requires a [5 dollar lifetime fee](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish#pay-the-developer-signup-fee) in order to submit extensions. The low cost allows the development of many quality Open Source Web Extensions that do not aim to monetize through usage.\n\nChrome has the largest share of global usage and is the preferred target platform for the majority of developers. Major technologies are based on Chrome's Open Source components, such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which uses [Chrome's V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) Engine and the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) framework, which is based on Chromium and node.js. Chrome's vast user base makes it the most attractive target for threat actors and security researchers. Despite under constants attacks, Chrome has retained an impressive security track record over the years. This is not a small feat.\n\nChrome offers [separate profiles](https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/multi-profiles), [sandboxing](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox), [frequent updates](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/) (including Flash, although you should disable it - see below), and carries [impressive credentials](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet). In addition, Google offers a very lucrative [bounty](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/chrome-rewards/) program for reporting vulnerabilities along with its own [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com). This means that a large number of highly talented and motivated people are constantly auditing Chrome's code base.\n\nCreate separate Chrome profiles to reduce XSS risk and compartmentalize cookies/identities. In each profile, either disable Javascript in Chrome settings and manually whitelist allowed origins - or use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to manage Javascript and/or disable third-party scripts/frames. Also install [HTTPSEverywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to upgrade insecure connections.\n\nChange the default search engine from Google to reduce additional tracking.\n\nDisable [DNS prefetching](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/dns-prefetching) (see also [DNS Prefetching and Its Privacy Implications](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/leet10/tech/full_papers/Krishnan.pdf) (pdf)). Note that Chrome [may attempt](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/350) to resolve DNS using Google's `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` public nameservers.\n\nRead [Chromium Security](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) and [Chromium Privacy](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy) for more detailed, technical information.\n\nRead [Google's privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and learn which [Google services](https://www.google.com/services/) collect personal information. Users can opt-out of services and see what type of information Google has stored in [account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy).\n\n#### Safari\n\n[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) is the default Web browser of macOS. It is also the most optimized browser for reducing battery use. Safari, like Chrome, has both Open Source and proprietary components. Safari is based on the open source Web Engine [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit), which is ubiquitous among the macOS ecosystem. WebKit is used by Apple apps such as Mail, iTunes, iBooks, and the App Store. Chrome's [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) engine is a fork of WebKit and both engines share a number of similarities.\n\nSafari supports certain unique features that benefit user security and privacy. [Content blockers](https://webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/) enables the creation of content blocking rules without using Javascript. This rule based approach greatly improves memory use, security, and privacy. Safari 11 introduced an [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) system. This feature automatically removes tracking data stored in Safari after a period of non-interaction by the user from the tracker's website.\n\nSimilar to Chrome and Firefox, Safari offers an invite only [bounty program](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/) for bug reporting to a select number of security researchers. The bounty program was announced during Apple's [presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf) at [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#behind-the-scenes-of-ios-security) 2016.\n\nWeb Extensions in Safari have an additional option to use native code in the Safari's sandbox environment, in addition to Web Extension APIs. Web Extensions in Safari are also distributed through Apple's App store. App store submission comes with the added benefit of Web Extension code being audited by Apple. On the other hand App store submission comes at a steep cost. Yearly [developer subscription](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) fee costs 100 USD (in contrast to Chrome's 5 dollar lifetime fee and Firefox's free submission). The high cost is prohibitive for the majority of Open Source developers. As a result, Safari has very few extensions to choose from. However, you should keep the high cost in mind when installing extensions. It is expected that most Web Extensions will have some way of monetizing usage in order to cover developer costs. Be wary of Web Extensions whose source code is not open.\n\nSafari syncs user preferences and saved passwords with [iCloud Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202303). In order to be viewed in plain text, a user must input the account password of the current device. This means that users can sync data across devices with added security.\n\nSafari follows a slower release cycle than Chrome and Firefox (3-4 minor releases, 1 major release, per year). Newer features are slower to be adopted to the stable channel. Although security updates in Safari are handled independent of the stable release schedule and issued automatically through the App store. The Safari channel that follows a six-week release cycle (similar to as Chrome and Firefox) is called [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) and it is the recommended option instead of the stable channel of Safari.\n\nAn excellent open source ad blocker for Safari that fully leverages content blockers is [dgraham/Ka-Block](https://github.com/dgraham/Ka-Block). See also [el1t/uBlock-Safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/wiki/Disable-hyperlink-auditing-beacon) to disable hyperlink auditing beacons.\n\n#### Other Web browsers\n\nMany Chromium-derived browsers are not recommended. They are usually [closed source](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=4176879&cid=44774943), [poorly maintained](https://plus.google.com/+JustinSchuh/posts/69qw9wZVH8z), [have bugs](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=679), and make dubious claims to protect privacy. See [The Private Life of Chromium Browsers](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517132144/http://thesimplecomputer.info/the-private-life-of-chromium-browsers).\n\nOther miscellaneous browsers, such as [Brave](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/94), are not evaluated in this guide, so are neither recommended nor actively discouraged from use.\n\n#### Web browsers and privacy\n\nAll Web Browsers retain certain information about our browsing habits. That information is used for a number of reasons. One of them is to improve the overall performance of the Web Browser. Most Web Browsers offer prediction services to resolve typos or URL redirections, store analytics data of browsing patterns, crash reports and black listing of known malicious servers. Those options can be turned on and off from each Web browser's settings panel.\n\nSince Web browsers execute untrusted code from the server, it is important to understand what type of information can be accessed. The [Navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) interface gives access to information about the Web Browser's user agent. Those include information such as the operating system, Web sites' permissions, and the device's battery level. For more information about security conscious browsing and what type of information is being \"leaked\" by your browser, see [HowTo: Privacy & Security Conscious Browsing](https://gist.github.com/atcuno/3425484ac5cce5298932), [browserleaks.com](https://www.browserleaks.com/) and [EFF Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).\n\nTo hinder third party trackers, it is recommended to **disable third-party cookies** in Web browser settings. A third party cookie is a cookie associated with a file requested by a different domain than the one the user is currently viewing. Most of the time third-party cookies are used to create browsing profiles by tracking a user's movement on the web. Disabling third-party cookies prevents HTTP responses and scripts from other domains from setting cookies. Moreover, cookies are removed from requests to domains that are not the document origin domain, so cookies are only sent to the current site that is being viewed.\n\nAlso be aware of [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC#Concerns), which may reveal your local or public (if connected to VPN) IP address(es). In Firefox and Chrome/Chromium this can be disabled with extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Prevent-WebRTC-from-leaking-local-IP-address) and [rentamob/WebRTC-Leak-Prevent](https://github.com/rentamob/WebRTC-Leak-Prevent). Disabling WebRTC in Safari is only possible with a [system hack](https://github.com/JayBrown/Disable-and-toggle-WebRTC-in-macOS-Safari).\n\n### Plugins\n\n**Adobe Flash**, **Oracle Java**, **Adobe Reader**, **Microsoft Silverlight** (Netflix now works with [HTML5](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742)) and other plugins are [security risks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9901480) and should not be installed.\n\nIf they are necessary, only use them in a disposable virtual machine and subscribe to security announcements to make sure you're always patched.\n\nSee [Hacking Team Flash Zero-Day](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-integrated-into-exploit-kits/), [Java Trojan BackDoor.Flashback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_BackDoor.Flashback), [Acrobat Reader: Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-497/Adobe-Acrobat-Reader.html), and [Angling for Silverlight Exploits](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/angling-for-silverlight-exploits) for examples.\n\n## Tor\n\nTor is an anonymizing proxy which can be used for browsing the Web.\n\nDownload Tor Browser from [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/download/).\n\nDo **not** attempt to configure other browsers or applications to use Tor as you may make a mistake which will compromise anonymity.\n\nDownload both the `dmg` and `asc` signature files, then verify the disk image has been signed by Tor developers:\n\n```console\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n\n$ file Tor*\nTorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg:     bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k\nTorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc: PGP signature Signature (old)\n\n$ gpg Tor*asc\n[...]\ngpg: Can't check signature: No public key\n\n$ gpg --recv 0x4E2C6E8793298290\ngpg: key 0x4E2C6E8793298290: public key \"Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>\" imported\ngpg: no ultimately trusted keys found\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:               imported: 1\n\n$ gpg --verify Tor*asc\ngpg: assuming signed data in 'TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg'\ngpg: Signature made Mon Dec 10 07:16:22 2018 PST\ngpg:                using RSA key 0xEB774491D9FF06E2\ngpg: Good signature from \"Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>\" [unknown]\ngpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!\ngpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.\nPrimary key fingerprint: EF6E 286D DA85 EA2A 4BA7  DE68 4E2C 6E87 9329 8290\n     Subkey fingerprint: 1107 75B5 D101 FB36 BC6C  911B EB77 4491 D9FF 06E2\n```\n\nMake sure `Good signature from \"Tor Browser Developers (signing key) <torbrowser@torproject.org>\"` appears in the output. The warning about the key not being certified is benign, as it has not yet been manually assigned trust.\n\nSee [How to verify signatures for packages](https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html) for more information.\n\nTo finish installing Tor Browser, open the disk image and drag the it into the Applications folder, or with:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil mount TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n\n$ cp -r /Volumes/Tor\\ Browser/Tor\\ Browser.app/ ~/Applications/\n\n```\n\nVerify the Tor application's code signature was made by with The Tor Project's Apple developer ID **MADPSAYN6T**, using the `spctl -a -v` and/or `pkgutil --check-signature` commands:\n\n```console\n$ spctl -a -vv ~/Applications/Tor\\ Browser.app\n/Users/drduh/Applications/Tor Browser.app: accepted\nsource=Developer ID\norigin=Developer ID Application: The Tor Project, Inc (MADPSAYN6T)\n\n$ pkgutil --check-signature ~/Applications/Tor\\ Browser.app\nPackage \"Tor Browser.app\":\n   Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X\n   Certificate Chain:\n    1.

The Tor network does not guarantee protection against a global observer capable of traffic analysis and [correlation](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/traffic-correlation). See also [Seeking Anonymity in an Internet Panopticon](http://bford.info/pub/net/panopticon-cacm.pdf) (pdf) and [Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries](http://www.ohmygodel.com/publications/usersrouted-ccs13.pdf) (pdf).\n\nAlso see [Invisible Internet Project (I2P)](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro) and its [Tor comparison](https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor).\n\n## VPN\n\nUnencrypted network traffic is being actively monitored and possibly tampered with. Encrypted traffic still exposes [connection metadata](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/142833/does-https-encrypt-metadata#142855) and could be used to infer behavior or specific actions.\n\nIt is a good idea to use a VPN with outgoing network traffic (*not* **split tunnel**) together with a trustworthy provider. [drduh/Debian-Privacy-Server-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/Debian-Privacy-Server-Guide) is one of many available guides for setting up a personal VPN server.\n\nDon't just blindly sign up for a VPN service without understanding the full implications and how your traffic will be routed. If you don't understand how the VPN works or are not familiar with the software used, you are probably better off without it.\n\nWhen choosing a VPN service or setting up your own, be sure to research the protocols, key exchange algorithms, authentication mechanisms, and type of encryption being used. Some protocols, such as [PPTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol#Security), should be avoided in favor of [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) or Linux-based [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) [on a Linux VM](https://github.com/mrash/Wireguard-macOS-LinuxVM) or via a set of [cross platform tools](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/).\n\nSome clients may send traffic over the next available interface when VPN is interrupted or disconnected. See [scy/8122924](https://gist.github.com/scy/8122924) for an example on how to allow traffic only over VPN.\n\nAnother set of scripts to lock down your system so it will only access the internet via a VPN can be found as part of the Voodoo Privacy project - [sarfata/voodooprivacy](https://github.com/sarfata/voodooprivacy) and there is an updated guide to setting up an IPSec VPN on a virtual machine ([hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn)) or a docker container ([hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server)).\n\nIt may be worthwhile to consider the geographical location of the VPN provider. See further discussion in [issue #114](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/114).\n\nAlso see this [technical overview](https://blog.timac.org/2018/0717-macos-vpn-architecture/) of the macOS built-in VPN L2TP/IPSec and IKEv2 client.\n\nOther open source OpenVPN clients/GUI: [Eddie](https://github.com/AirVPN/Eddie), [Pritunl](https://client.pritunl.com) are not evaluated in this guide, so are neither recommended nor actively discouraged from use.\n\n## PGP/GPG\n\nPGP is a standard for encrypting email end to end. That means only the chosen recipients can decrypt a message, unlike regular email which is read and forever archived by providers.\n\nGPG, or **GNU Privacy Guard**, is a GPL-licensed open source program compliant with the PGP standard.\n\nGPG is used to verify signatures of software you download and install, as well as [symmetrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) or [asymmetrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) encrypt files and text.\n\nInstall from Homebrew with `brew install gnupg`.\n\nIf you prefer a graphical application, download and install [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/).\n\nDownload [drduh/config/gpg.conf](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf) to use recommended settings:\n\n```console\n$ curl -o ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf\n```\n\nSee [drduh/YubiKey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) to securely generate and store GPG keys.\n\nRead [online](https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/) [guides](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/31594/what-is-a-good-general-purpose-gnupg-key-setup) and [practice](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices) encrypting and decrypting email to yourself and your friends. Get them interested in this stuff!\n\n## OTR\n\nOTR stands for **off-the-record** and is a cryptographic protocol for encrypting and authenticating conversations over instant messaging.\n\nYou can use OTR on top of any existing [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about) chat service, even Google Hangouts (which only encrypts conversations between users and the server using TLS).\n\nThe first time you start a conversation with someone new, you'll be asked to verify their public key fingerprint. Make sure to do this in person or by some other secure means (e.g. GPG encrypted mail).\n\nA popular macOS GUI client for XMPP and other chat protocols is [Adium](https://adium.im/). \n\nOther XMPP clients include [profanity](http://www.profanity.im/) and [agl/xmpp-client](https://github.com/agl/xmpp-client). Another relatively new XMPP chat client is [CoyIM](https://coy.im/), it's focused and security and has built-in support for OTR and Tor.\n\nIf you want to know how OTR works, read the paper [Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/otr-wpes.pdf) (pdf)\n\n## Viruses and malware\n\nThere is an [ever-increasing](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2459197-bit9-carbon-black-threat-research-report-2015.html) amount of Mac malware in the wild. Macs aren't immune from viruses and malicious software!\n\nSome malware comes bundled with both legitimate software, such as the [Java bundling Ask Toolbar](https://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-extends-its-adware-bundling-to-include-java-for-macs/), and some with illegitimate software, such as [Mac.BackDoor.iWorm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOfXRUQJgMjJSLBSoLiUaSZfiaS_vU3aG4Bvjmz6Dxs/edit?pli=1) bundled with pirated programs. [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/antimalware/mac/) is an excellent program for ridding oneself of \"garden-variety\" malware and other \"crapware\".\n\nSee [Methods of malware persistence on Mac OS X](https://www.virusbtn.com/pdf/conference/vb2014/VB2014-Wardle.pdf) (pdf) and [Malware Persistence on OS X Yosemite](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/agenda/sessions/1591/malware-persistence-on-os-x-yosemite) to learn about how garden-variety malware functions.\n\nYou could periodically run a tool like [Knock Knock](https://github.com/synack/knockknock) to examine persistent applications (e.g. scripts, binaries). But by then, it is probably too late. Maybe applications such as [Block Block](https://objective-see.com/products/blockblock.html) and [Ostiarius](https://objective-see.com/products/ostiarius.html) will help. See warnings and caveats in [issue #90](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/90) first, however. An open-source alternative could be [maclaunch.sh](https://github.com/hazcod/maclaunch).\n\n**Anti-virus** programs are a double-edged sword -- not so useful for **advanced** users and will likely increase attack surface against sophisticated threats; however possibly useful for catching \"garden variety\" malware on **novice** users' Macs. There is also the additional processing overhead to consider when using \"active\" scanning features.\n\nSee [Sophail: Applied attacks against Antivirus](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sophailv2.pdf) (pdf), [Analysis and Exploitation of an ESET Vulnerability](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.ro/2015/06/analysis-and-exploitation-of-eset.html), [a trivial Avast RCE](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=546), [Popular Security Software Came Under Relentless NSA and GCHQ Attacks](https://theintercept.com/2015/06/22/nsa-gchq-targeted-kaspersky/), [How Israel Caught Russian Hackers Scouring the World for U.S. Secrets](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html) and [AVG: \"Web TuneUP\" extension multiple critical vulnerabilities](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=675).\n\nTherefore, the best anti-virus is **Common Sense 2020**. See discussion in [issue #44](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/44).\n\nLocal privilege escalation bugs are plenty on macOS, so always be careful when downloading and running untrusted programs or trusted programs from third party websites or downloaded over HTTP ([example](https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/0-day-bug-in-fully-patched-os-x-comes-under-active-exploit-to-hijack-macs/)).\n\nSubscribe to updates at [The Safe Mac](http://www.thesafemac.com/) and [Malwarebytes Blog](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/) for current Mac security news.\n\nTo scan an application with multiple AV products and examine its behavior, upload it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload).\n\nAlso check out [Hacking Team](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/hacking_team_is.html) malware for macOS: [root installation for MacOS](https://github.com/hackedteam/vector-macos-root), [Support driver for Mac Agent](https://github.com/hackedteam/driver-macos) and [RCS Agent for Mac](https://github.com/hackedteam/core-macos), which is a good example of advanced malware with capabilities to hide from userland (e.g., `ps`, `ls`). For more, see [A Brief Analysis of an RCS Implant Installer](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x0D.html) and [reverse.put.as](https://reverse.put.as/2016/02/29/the-italian-morons-are-back-what-are-they-up-to-this-time/)\n\n## System Integrity Protection\n\n[System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) (SIP) is a security feature since OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\". It is enabled by default, but [can be disabled](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/system-integrity-protection-adding-another-layer-to-apples-security-model/), which may be necessary to change some system settings, such as deleting root certificate authorities or unloading certain launch daemons. Keep this feature on, as it is by default.\n\nFrom [What's New in OS X 10.11](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_11.html):\n\n> A new security policy that applies to every running process, including privileged code and code that runs out of the sandbox. The policy extends additional protections to components on disk and at run-time, only allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and software updates. Code injection and runtime attachments to system binaries are no longer permitted.\n\nAlso see [What is the “rootless” feature in El Capitan, really?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193368/what-is-the-rootless-feature-in-el-capitan-really)\n\nSome MacBook hardware has shipped with [SIP disabled](https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/11/17/system-integrity-protection-disabled-by-default-on-some-touch-bar-macbook-pros). To verify SIP is enabled, use the command `csrutil status`, which should return: `System Integrity Protection status: enabled.` Otherwise, [enable SIP](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html) through Recovery Mode.\n\n## Gatekeeper and XProtect\n\n**Gatekeeper** and the **quarantine** system try to prevent unsigned or \"bad\" programs and files from running and opening.\n\n**XProtect** prevents the execution of known bad files and outdated plugin versions, but does nothing to cleanup or stop existing malware.\n\nBoth offer trivial protection against common risks and are fine at default settings.\n\nSee also [Mac Malware Guide : How does Mac OS X protect me?](http://www.thesafemac.com/mmg-builtin/) and [Gatekeeper, XProtect and the Quarantine attribute](https://ilostmynotes.blogspot.com/2012/06/gatekeeper-xprotect-and-quarantine.html).\n\n**Note** Quarantine stores information about downloaded files in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2`, which may pose a privacy risk. To examine the file, simply use `strings` or the following command:\n\n```console\n$ echo 'SELECT datetime(LSQuarantineTimeStamp + 978307200, \"unixepoch\") as LSQuarantineTimeStamp, ' \\\n  'LSQuarantineAgentName, LSQuarantineOriginURLString, LSQuarantineDataURLString from LSQuarantineEvent;' | \\\n  sqlite3 /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2\n```\n\nSee [here](https://www.zoharbabin.com/hey-mac-i-dont-appreciate-you-spying-on-me-hidden-downloads-log-in-os-x/) for more information.\n\nTo permanently disable this feature, [clear the file](https://superuser.com/questions/90008/how-to-clear-the-contents-of-a-file-from-the-command-line) and [make it immutable](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031017061722471):\n\n```console\n$ :>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2\n\n$ sudo chflags schg ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also disable Gatekeeper using the following command: \n\n```sudo spctl --master-disable```\n\n(See <https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/> and <https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x64.html> for reference)\n\n## Metadata and artifacts\n\nmacOS attaches metadata ([HFS+ extended attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#OS_X)) to downloaded files, which can be viewed with the `mdls` and `xattr` commands:\n\n```console\n$ ls -l@ ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 drduh staff 63M Jan 1 12:00 TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n\tcom.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms\t  46B\n\tcom.apple.quarantine\t  57B\n\n$ mdls ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\nkMDItemContentCreationDate         = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemContentCreationDate_Ranking = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemContentModificationDate     = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemContentType                 = \"com.apple.disk-image-udif\"\nkMDItemContentTypeTree             = (\n    \"public.archive\",\n    \"public.item\",\n    \"public.data\",\n    \"public.disk-image\",\n    \"com.apple.disk-image\",\n    \"com.apple.disk-image-udif\"\n)\nkMDItemDateAdded                   = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemDateAdded_Ranking           = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemDisplayName                 = \"TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\"\nkMDItemFSContentChangeDate         = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreationDate              = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemFSCreatorCode               = \"\"\nkMDItemFSFinderFlags               = 0\nkMDItemFSHasCustomIcon             = (null)\nkMDItemFSInvisible                 = 0\nkMDItemFSIsExtensionHidden         = 0\nkMDItemFSIsStationery              = (null)\nkMDItemFSLabel                     = 0\nkMDItemFSName                      = \"TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\"\nkMDItemFSNodeCount                 = (null)\nkMDItemFSOwnerGroupID              = 5000\nkMDItemFSOwnerUserID               = 501\nkMDItemFSSize                      = 65840402\nkMDItemFSTypeCode                  = \"\"\nkMDItemInterestingDate_Ranking     = 2019-01-01 00:00:00 +0000\nkMDItemKind                        = \"Disk Image\"\nkMDItemWhereFroms                  = (\n    \"https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/8.0.4/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\",\n    \"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\"\n)\n\n$ xattr -l ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms:\n00000000  62 70 6C 69 73 74 30 30 A2 01 02 5F 10 4D 68 74  |bplist00..._.Mht|\n00000010  74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 64 69 73 74 2E 74 6F 72 70 72  |tps://dist.torpr|\n00000020  6F 6A 65 63 74 2E 6F 72 67 2F 74 6F 72 62 72 6F  |oject.org/torbro|\n[...]\ncom.apple.quarantine: 0081;58519ffa;Google Chrome.app;1F032CAB-F5A1-4D92-84EB-CBECA971B7BC\n```\n\nMetadata attributes can also be removed with the `-d` flag:\n\n```console\n$ xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n\n$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n\n$ xattr -l ~/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n[No output expected]\n```\n\nOther metadata and artifacts may be found in the directories including, but not limited to, `~/Library/Preferences/`, `~/Library/Containers/<APP>/Data/Library/Preferences`, `/Library/Preferences`, some of which is detailed below.\n\n`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist` contains historical list of volumes attached.

Disable the thumbnail cache with `qlmanage -r disablecache`\n\nIt can also be manually cleared by getting the directory names with `getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR` and `sudo getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR`, then removing them:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/exclusive\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite-shm\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite-wal\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/resetreason\n$ rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/thumbnails.data\n```\n\nSimilarly, for the root user:\n\n```console\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/thumbnails.fraghandler\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/exclusive\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite-shm\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/index.sqlite-wal\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/resetreason\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/thumbnails.data\n$ sudo rm -rfv $(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/thumbnails.fraghandler\n```\n\nAlso see ['quicklook' cache may leak encrypted data](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x30.html).\n\nTo clear Finder preferences:\n\n```console\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist FXDesktopVolumePositions\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist FXRecentFolders\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist RecentMoveAndCopyDestinations\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist RecentSearches\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist SGTRecentFileSearches\n```\n\nAdditional diagnostic files may be found in the following directories - but caution should be taken before removing any, as it may break logging or cause other issues:\n\n```\n/var/db/CoreDuet/\n/var/db/diagnostics/\n/var/db/systemstats/\n/var/db/uuidtext/\n/var/log/DiagnosticMessages/\n```\n\nmacOS stored preferred Wi-Fi data (including credentials) in NVRAM. To clear it, use the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ sudo nvram -d 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:current-network\n$ sudo nvram -d 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:preferred-networks\n$ sudo nvram -d 36C28AB5-6566-4C50-9EBD-CBB920F83843:preferred-count\n```\n\nmacOS may collect sensitive information about what you type, even if user dictionary and suggestions are off. To remove them, and prevent them from being created again, use the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/LanguageModeling/*\" \"~/Library/Spelling/*\" \"~/Library/Suggestions/*\"\n$ chmod -R 000 ~/Library/LanguageModeling ~/Library/Spelling ~/Library/Suggestions\n$ chflags -R uchg ~/Library/LanguageModeling ~/Library/Spelling ~/Library/Suggestions\n```\n\nQuickLook application support metadata can be cleared and locked with the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/Application Support/Quick Look/*\"\n$ chmod -R 000 \"~/Library/Application Support/Quick Look\"\n$ chflags -R uchg \"~/Library/Application Support/Quick Look\"\n```\n\nDocument revision metadata is stored in `/.DocumentRevisions-V100` and can be cleared and locked with the following commands - caution should be taken as this may break some core Apple applications:\n\n```console\n$ sudo rm -rfv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/*\n$ sudo chmod -R 000 /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n$ sudo chflags -R uchg /.DocumentRevisions-V100\n```\n\nSaved application state metadata may be cleared and locked with the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/Saved Application State/*\"\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/Containers/<APPNAME>/Saved Application State\"\n$ chmod -R 000 \"~/Library/Saved Application State/\"\n$ chmod -R 000 \"~/Library/Containers/<APPNAME>/Saved Application State\"\n$ chflags -R uchg \"~/Library/Saved Application State/\"\n$ chflags -R uchg \"~/Library/Containers/<APPNAME>/Saved Application State\"\n```\n\nAutosave metadata can be cleared and locked with the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/Containers/<APP>/Data/Library/Autosave Information\"\n$ rm -rfv \"~/Library/Autosave Information\"\n$ chmod -R 000 \"~/Library/Containers/<APP>/Data/Library/Autosave Information\"\n$ chmod -R 000 \"~/Library/Autosave Information\"\n$ chflags -R uchg \"~/Library/Containers/<APP>/Data/Library/Autosave Information\"\n$ chflags -R uchg \"~/Library/Autosave Information\"\n```\n\nThe Siri analytics database, which is created even if the Siri launch agent disabled, can be cleared and locked with the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ rm -rfv ~/Library/Assistant/SiriAnalytics.db\n$ chmod -R 000 ~/Library/Assistant/SiriAnalytics.db\n$ chflags -R uchg ~/Library/Assistant/SiriAnalytics.db\n```\n\n`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist` contains iTunes metadata. Recent iTunes search data may be cleared with the following command:\n\n```console\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist recentSearches\n```\n\nIf you do not use Apple ID-linked services, the following keys may be cleared, too, using the following commands:\n\n```console\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist StoreUserInfo\n$ defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist WirelessBuddyID\n```\n\nAll media played in QuickTime Player can be found in:\n\n```\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.plist\n```\n\nAdditional metadata may exist in the following files:\n\n```\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.appstore/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce.knownclients.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.plist\n```\n\n## Passwords\n\nGenerate strong passwords with several programs or directly from [`/dev/urandom`](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/issues/594):\n\n```console\n$ openssl rand -base64 30\nqb8ZWbUU2Ri3FOAPY/1wKSFAJwMXmpQM4mZU4YbO\n\n$ gpg --gen-random -a 0 90 | fold -w 40\n3e+kfHOvovHVXxZYPgu+OOWQ1g1ttbljr+kNGv7f\nloD//RsjUXYGIjfPM/bT0itsoEstyGLVUsFns8wP\nzYM8VRBga+TsnxWrS7lWKfH1uvVPowzkq9kXCdvJ\n\n$ LANG=C tr -dc 'A-F0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 40 | head -n 5\n45D0371481EE5E5A5C1F68EA59E69F9CA52CB321\nA30B37A00302643921F205621B145E7EAF520164\nB6EF38A2DA1D0586D20105502AFFF0468EA5F16A\n029D6EA9F76CD64D3356E342EA154BEFEBE23387\n07F468F0569579A0A06471247CABC4F4C1386E24\n\n$ tr -dc '[:alnum:]' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 40 | head -n5\nzmj8S0iuxud8y8YHjzdg7Hefu6U1KAYBiLl3aE8v\nnCNpuMkWohTjQHntTzbiLQJG5zLzEHWSWaYSwjtm\nR2L6M909S3ih852IkJqQFMDawCiHcpPBxlllAPrt\naZOXKVUmxhzQwVSYb6nqAbGTVMFSJOLf094bFZAb\nHfgwSNlkVBXwIPQST6E6x6vDNCCasMLSSOoTUfSK\n\n$ tr -dc '[:lower:]' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 40 | head -n5\ngfvkanntxutzwxficgvavbwdvttexdezdftvvtmn\nlgrsuiugwkqbtbkyggcbpbqlynwbiyxzlabstqcf\nufctdlsbyonkowzpmotxiksnsbwdzkjrjsupoqvr\nhjwibdjxtmuvqricljayzkgdfztcmapsgwsubggr\nbjstlmvwjczakgeetkbmwbjnidbeaerhaonpkacg\n\n$ tr -dc '[:upper:]' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 40 | head -n5\nEUHZMAOBOLNFXUNNDSTLJTPDCPVQBPUEQOLRZUQZ\nHVNVKBEPAAYMXRCGVCNEZLFHNUYMRYPTWPWOOZVM\nTAHEUPQJTSYQVJVYSKLURESMKWEZONXLUDHWQODB\nPRDITWMAXXZLTRXEEOGOSGAWUXYDGDRJYRHUWICM\nVHERIQBLBPHSIUZSGYZRDHTNAPUGJMRODIKBWZRJ\n\n$ tr -dc '[:graph:]' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 40 | head -n5\nn\\T2|zUz:\\C,@z9!#p3!B/[t6m:B94}q&t(^)Ol~\nJ%MMDbAgGdP}zrSQO!3mrP3$w!.[Ng_xx-_[C<3g\n^)6V&*<2\"ZOgU.mBd]iInvFKiT<dq~y\\O[cdDK`V\n+RE]UYPIf3:StX`y#w,.iG~g\"urD)'FnDIFI_q^)\n6?HRillpgvvFDBAr4[:H{^oAL<`Em7$roF=2w;1~\n```\n\nYou can also generate passwords, even memorable ones, using **Keychain Access** password assistant, or a command line equivalent like [anders/pwgen](https://github.com/anders/pwgen).\n\nKeychains are encrypted with a [PBKDF2 derived key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) and are a _pretty safe_ place to store credentials. See also [Breaking into the OS X keychain](http://juusosalonen.com/post/30923743427/breaking-into-the-os-x-keychain). Also be aware that Keychain [does not encrypt](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/118) the names corresponding to password entries.\n\nAlternatively, you can manage an encrypted passwords file yourself with GnuPG (see [drduh/Purse](https://github.com/drduh/Purse) and [drduh/pwd.sh](https://github.com/drduh/pwd.sh) for example).\n\nIn addition to passwords, ensure eligible online accounts, such as GitHub, Google accounts, banking, have [two factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication) enabled.\n\n[Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/) offers affordable hardware tokens. See [drduh/YubiKey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) and [trmm.net/Yubikey](https://trmm.net/Yubikey). One of two Yubikey's slots can also be programmed to emit a long, static password (which can be used in combination with a short, memorized password, for example).\n\nIn Addition to Login and other PAMs, you can use Yubikey to secure your login and sudo, here is a pdf guide from [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yubico_YubiKeyMacOSXLogin_en.pdf). Yubikey are a bit pricey, there is cheaper alternative, but not as capable, [U2F Zero](https://www.u2fzero.com/). Here is a great guide to [set it up](https://microamps.gibsjose.com/u2f-authentication-on-os-x/)\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways encrypt files locally before backing them up to external media or online services.\n\nOne way is to use a symmetric cipher with GPG and a password of your choosing. Files can also be encrypted to a public key with GPG, with the private key stored on [YubiKey](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide).\n\nTo compress and encrypt a directory:\n\n```console\n$ tar zcvf - ~/Downloads | gpg -c > ~/Desktop/backup-$(date +%F-%H%M).tar.gz.gpg\ntar: Removing leading '/' from member names\na Users/drduh/Downloads\na Users/drduh/Downloads/.DS_Store\na Users/drduh/Downloads/.localized\na Users/drduh/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc\na Users/drduh/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n```\n\nTo decrypt and decompress the directory:\n\n```console\n$ gpg -o ~/Desktop/decrypted-backup.tar.gz -d ~/Desktop/backup-2015-01-01-0000.tar.gz.gpg\ngpg: AES256 encrypted data\ngpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase\n\n$ tar zxvf ~/Desktop/decrypted-backup.tar.gz\ntar: Removing leading '/' from member names\nx Users/drduh/._Downloads\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/._.DS_Store\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/.DS_Store\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/.localized\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/._TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/._TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\nx Users/drduh/Downloads/TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg\n```\n\nYou can also create and use encrypted volumes using **Disk Utility** or `hdiutil`:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil create ~/Desktop/encrypted.dmg -encryption -size 50M -volname \"secretStuff\" -fs JHFS+\nEnter a new password to secure \"encrypted.dmg\":\nRe-enter new password:\n....................................\nCreated: /Users/drduh/Desktop/encrypted.img\n\n$ hdiutil mount ~/Desktop/encrypted.dmg\nEnter password to access \"encrypted.dmg\":\n[...]\n/Volumes/secretStuff\n\n$ cp -v ~/Documents/passwords.txt /Volumes/secretStuff\n[...]\n\n$ hdiutil eject /Volumes/secretStuff\n\"disk4\" unmounted.\n\"disk4\" ejected.\n```\n\nWith `hdiutil` you are also able to add the option `-type SPARSE-BUNDLE`. With these sparse bundles you may achieve faster backups because after the first run, the updated information and some padding needs to be transferred.\n\nA simple way to synchronize this encrypted folder to another server is using rsync:\n\n```console\nrsync --recursive --times --progress --delete --verbose --stats MyEncryptedDrive.sparsebundle user@server:/path/to/backup\n```\n\nSee also the following applications and services: [Tresorit](https://www.tresorit.com), [SpiderOak](https://www.spideroak.com/), [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/), [Espionage](https://www.espionageapp.com/), and [restic](https://restic.github.io/).\n\n## Wi-Fi\n\nmacOS remembers access points it has connected to. Like all wireless devices, the Mac will broadcast all access point names it remembers (e.g., *MyHomeNetwork*) each time it looks for a network, such as when waking from sleep.\n\nThis is a privacy risk, so remove networks from the list in **System Preferences** > **Network** > **Advanced** when they are no longer needed.\n\nAlso see [Signals from the Crowd: Uncovering Social Relationships through Smartphone Probes](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc148-barberaSP106.pdf) (pdf) and [Wi-Fi told me everything about you](http://confiance-numerique.clermont-universite.fr/Slides/M-Cunche-2014.pdf) (pdf).\n\nSaved Wi-Fi information (SSID, last connection, etc.) can be found in:\n\n    /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\nYou may want to [spoof the MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing) of the network card before connecting to new and untrusted wireless networks to mitigate passive fingerprinting:\n\n```console\n$ sudo ifconfig en0 ether $(openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's%\\(..\\)%\\1:%g; s%.$%%')\n```\n\nmacOS stores Wi-Fi SSIDs and passwords in NVRAM in order for Recovery Mode to access the Internet. Be sure to either clear NVRAM or de-authenticate your Mac from your Apple account, which will clear the NVRAM, before passing a Mac along. Resetting the SMC will clear some of the NVRAM, but not all.\n\n**Note** MAC addresses will reset to hardware defaults on each boot.\n\nFinally, WEP protection on wireless networks is [not secure](http://www.howtogeek.com/167783/htg-explains-the-difference-between-wep-wpa-and-wpa2-wireless-encryption-and-why-it-matters/) and you should only connect to **WPA2** protected networks when possible.\n\n## SSH\n\nFor outgoing SSH connections, use hardware or password-protected keys, [set up](http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/) remote hosts and consider [hashing](http://nms.csail.mit.edu/projects/ssh/) them for added privacy. See [drduh/config/ssh_config](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/ssh_config) for recommended client options.\n\nYou can also use ssh to create an [encrypted tunnel](http://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html) to send traffic through, similar to a VPN.\n\nFor example, to use Privoxy running on a remote host port 8118:\n\n```console\n$ ssh -C -L 5555:127.0.0.1:8118 you@remote-host.tld\n\n$ sudo networksetup -setwebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" 127.0.0.1 5555\n\n$ sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" 127.0.0.1 5555\n```\n\nOr to use an ssh connection as a [SOCKS proxy](https://www.mikeash.com/ssh_socks.html):\n\n```console\n$ ssh -NCD 3000 you@remote-host.tld\n```\n\nBy default, macOS does **not** have sshd or *Remote Login* enabled.\n\nTo enable sshd and allow incoming ssh connections:\n\n```console\n$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\n```\n\nOr use the **System Preferences** > **Sharing** menu.\n\nIf enabling sshd, be sure to disable password authentication and consider further [hardening](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html) your configuration. See [drduh/config/sshd_config](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/sshd_config) for recommended options.\n\nConfirm whether sshd is running:\n\n```console\n$ sudo lsof -Pni TCP:22\n```\n\n## Physical access\n\nKeep your Mac physically secure at all times. Don't leave it unattended in public spaces, such as hotels.\n\nA skilled attacker with unsupervised physical access to your computer can infect the boot ROM to install a keylogger and steal your password, for example - see [Thunderstrike](https://trmm.net/Thunderstrike).\n\nA helpful tool is [usbkill](https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill), which is an anti-forensic kill-switch that waits for a change on your USB ports and then immediately shuts down your computer.\n\nConsider purchasing a [privacy filter](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=node%3D15782001&field-keywords=macbook) for your screen to thwart shoulder surfers.\n\nSuperglues or epoxy resins can also be used to disable physical access to computer ports. [Nail polish](https://trmm.net/Glitter) and tamper-evidence seals can be applied to components to detect tampering.\n\n## System monitoring\n\n### OpenBSM audit\n\nmacOS has a powerful OpenBSM (Basic Security Module) auditing capability. You can use it to monitor process execution, network activity, and much more.\n\nTo tail audit logs, use the `praudit` utility:\n\n```console\n$ sudo praudit -l /dev/auditpipe\nheader,201,11,execve(2),0,Thu Sep  1 12:00:00 2015, + 195 msec,exec arg,/Applications/.evilapp/rootkit,path,/Applications/.evilapp/rootkit,path,/Applications/.evilapp/rootkit,attribute,100755,root,wheel,16777220,986535,0,subject,drduh,root,wheel,root,wheel,412,100005,50511731,0.0.0.0,return,success,0,trailer,201,\nheader,88,11,connect(2),0,Thu Sep  1 12:00:00 2015, + 238 msec,argument,1,0x5,fd,socket-inet,2,443,173.194.74.104,subject,drduh,root,wheel,root,wheel,326,100005,50331650,0.0.0.0,return,failure : Operation now in progress,4354967105,trailer,88\nheader,111,11,OpenSSH login,0,Thu Sep  1 12:00:00 2015, + 16 msec,subject_ex,drduh,drduh,staff,drduh,staff,404,404,49271,::1,text,successful login drduh,return,success,0,trailer,111,\n```\n\nSee the manual pages for `audit`, `praudit`, `audit_control` and other files in `/etc/security`\n\n**Note** although `man audit` says the `-s` flag will synchronize the audit configuration, it appears necessary to reboot for changes to take effect.\n\nSee articles on [ilostmynotes.blogspot.com](https://ilostmynotes.blogspot.com/2013/10/openbsm-auditd-on-os-x-these-are-logs.html) and [derflounder.wordpress.com](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/openbsm-auditing-on-mac-os-x/) for more information.\n\n### DTrace\n\n**Note** [System Integrity Protection](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide#system-integrity-protection) [interferes](https://internals.exposed/blog/dtrace-vs-sip.html) with DTrace, so it is not possible to use it in recent macOS versions without disabling SIP.\n\n* `iosnoop` monitors disk I/O\n* `opensnoop` monitors file opens\n* `execsnoop` monitors execution of processes\n* `errinfo` monitors failed system calls\n* `dtruss` monitors all system calls\n\nSee `man -k dtrace` for more information.\n\n### Execution\n\n`ps -ef` lists information about all running processes.\n\nYou can also view processes with **Activity Monitor**.\n\n`launchctl list` and `sudo launchctl list` list loaded and running user and system launch daemons and agents.\n\n### Network\n\nList open network files:\n\n```console\n$ sudo lsof -Pni\n```\n\nList contents of various network-related data structures:\n\n```console\n$ sudo netstat -atln\n```\n\n[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) can be used from the command line with `tshark`.\n\nMonitor DNS queries and replies:\n\n```console\n$ tshark -Y \"dns.flags.response == 1\" -Tfields \\\n  -e frame.time_delta \\\n  -e dns.qry.name \\\n  -e dns.a \\\n  -Eseparator=,\n```\n\nMonitor HTTP requests and responses:\n\n```console\n$ tshark -Y \"http.request or http.response\" -Tfields \\\n  -e ip.dst \\\n  -e http.request.full_uri \\\n  -e http.request.method \\\n  -e http.response.code \\\n  -e http.response.phrase \\\n  -Eseparator=/s\n```\n\nMonitor x509 (SSL/TLS) certificates:\n\n```console\n$ tshark -Y \"ssl.handshake.certificate\" -Tfields \\\n  -e ip.src \\\n  -e x509sat.uTF8String \\\n  -e x509sat.printableString \\\n  -e x509sat.universalString \\\n  -e x509sat.IA5String \\\n  -e x509sat.teletexString \\\n  -Eseparator=/s -Equote=d\n```\n\nAlso see the simple networking monitoring application [BonzaiThePenguin/Loading](https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/Loading).\n\n## Binary Whitelisting\n\n[google/santa](https://github.com/google/santa/) is a security software developed for Google's corporate Macintosh fleet and open sourced.\n\n> Santa is a binary whitelisting/blacklisting system for macOS. It consists of a kernel extension that monitors for executions, a userland daemon that makes execution decisions based on the contents of a SQLite database, a GUI agent that notifies the user in case of a block decision and a command-line utility for managing the system and synchronizing the database with a server.\n\nSanta uses the [Kernel Authorization API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2127/_index.html) to monitor and allow/disallow binaries from executing in the kernel. Binaries can be white- or black-listed by unique hash or signing developer certificate. Santa can be used to only allow trusted code execution, or to blacklist known malware from executing on a Mac, similar to Bit9 software for Windows.\n\n**Note** Santa does not currently have a graphical user interface for managing rules. The following instructions are for advanced users only!\n\nTo install Santa, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/google/santa/releases) page and download the latest disk image, the mount it and install the contained package:\n\n```console\n$ hdiutil mount ~/Downloads/santa-0.9.20.dmg\n\n$ sudo installer -pkg /Volumes/santa-0.9.20/santa-0.9.20.pkg -tgt /\n```\n\nBy default, Santa installs in \"Monitor\" mode (meaning, nothing gets blocked, only logged) and comes with two rules: one for Apple binaries and another for Santa software itself.\n\nVerify Santa is running and its kernel module is loaded:\n\n```console\n$ santactl status\n>>> Daemon Info\n  Mode                   | Monitor\n  File Logging           | No\n  Watchdog CPU Events    | 0  (Peak: 0.00%)\n  Watchdog RAM Events    | 0  (Peak: 0.00MB)\n>>> Kernel Info\n  Kernel cache count     | 0\n>>> Database Info\n  Binary Rules           | 0\n  Certificate Rules      | 2\n  Events Pending Upload  | 0\n\n$ ps -ef | grep \"[s]anta\"\n    0   786     1   0 10:01AM ??         0:00.39 /Library/Extensions/santa-driver.kext/Contents/MacOS/santad --syslog\n\n$ kextstat | grep santa\n  119    0 0xffffff7f822ff000 0x6000     0x6000     com.google.santa-driver (0.9.14) 693D8E4D-3161-30E0-B83D-66A273CAE026 <5 4 3 1>\n```\n\nCreate a blacklist rule to prevent iTunes from executing:\n\n```console\n$ sudo santactl rule --blacklist --path /Applications/iTunes.app/\nAdded rule for SHA-256: e1365b51d2cb2c8562e7f1de36bfb3d5248de586f40b23a2ed641af2072225b3.\n```\n\nTry to launch iTunes - it will be blocked.\n\n```console\n$ open /Applications/iTunes.app/\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/iTunes.app.\n```\n\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"Santa block dialog when attempting to run a blacklisted program\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12475110/21062284/14ddde88-be1e-11e6-8e9b-32f8a44c0cf6.png\">\n\nTo remove the rule:\n\n```console\n$ sudo santactl rule --remove --path /Applications/iTunes.app/\nRemoved rule for SHA-256: e1365b51d2cb2c8562e7f1de36bfb3d5248de586f40b23a2ed641af2072225b3.\n```\n\nOpen iTunes:\n\n```console\n$ open /Applications/iTunes.app/\n[iTunes will open successfully]\n```\n\nCreate a new, example C program:\n\n```console\n$ cat <<EOF > foo.c\n> #include <stdio.h>\n> main() { printf(\"Hello World\\n”); }\n> EOF\n```\n\nCompile the program with GCC (requires installation of Xcode or command-line tools):\n\n```console\n$ gcc -o foo foo.c\n\n$ file foo\nfoo: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64\n\n$ codesign -d foo\nfoo: code object is not signed at all\n```\n\nRun it:\n\n```console\n$ ./foo\nHello World\n```\n\nToggle Santa into \"Lockdown\" mode, which only allows whitelisted binaries to run:\n\n    $ sudo defaults write /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode -int 2\n\nTry to run the unsigned binary:\n\n```console\n$ ./foo\nbash: ./foo: Operation not permitted\n\nSanta\n\nThe following application has been blocked from executing\nbecause its trustworthiness cannot be determined.\n\nPath:       /Users/demouser/foo\nIdentifier: 4e11da26feb48231d6e90b10c169b0f8ae1080f36c168ffe53b1616f7505baed\nParent:     bash (701)\n```\n\nTo whitelist a specific binary, determine its SHA-256 sum:\n\n```console\n$ santactl fileinfo /Users/demouser/foo\nPath                 : /Users/demouser/foo\nSHA-256              : 4e11da26feb48231d6e90b10c169b0f8ae1080f36c168ffe53b1616f7505baed\nSHA-1                : 4506f3a8c0a5abe4cacb98e6267549a4d8734d82\nType                 : Executable (x86-64)\nCode-signed          : No\nRule                 : Blacklisted (Unknown)\n```\n\nAdd a whitelist rule:\n\n```console\n$ sudo santactl rule --whitelist --sha256 4e11da26feb48231d6e90b10c169b0f8ae1080f36c168ffe53b1616f7505baed\nAdded rule for SHA-256: 4e11da26feb48231d6e90b10c169b0f8ae1080f36c168ffe53b1616f7505baed.\n```\n\nRun it:\n\n```console\n$ ./foo\nHello World\n```\n\nIt's allowed and works!\n\nApplications can also be whitelisted by developer certificate (so that new binary versions will not need to be manually whitelisted on each update). For example, download and run Google Chrome - it will be blocked by Santa in \"Lockdown\" mode:\n\n```console\n$ curl -sO https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg\n\n$ hdiutil mount googlechrome.dmg\n\n$ cp -r /Volumes/Google\\ Chrome/Google\\ Chrome.app /Applications/\n\n$ open /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/Google Chrome.app.\n```\n\nWhitelist the application by its developer certificate (first item in the Signing Chain):\n\n```console\n$ santactl fileinfo /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/\nPath                 : /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\nSHA-256              : 0eb08224d427fb1d87d2276d911bbb6c4326ec9f74448a4d9a3cfce0c3413810\nSHA-1                : 9213cbc7dfaaf7580f3936a915faa56d40479f6a\nBundle Name          : Google Chrome\nBundle Version       : 2883.87\nBundle Version Str   : 55.0.2883.87\nType                 : Executable (x86-64)\nCode-signed          : Yes\nRule                 : Blacklisted (Unknown)\nSigning Chain:\n     1.

To whitelist it:\n\n```console\n$ sudo santactl rule --whitelist --certificate --sha256 15b8ce88e10f04c88a5542234fbdfc1487e9c2f64058a05027c7c34fc4201153\nAdded rule for SHA-256: 15b8ce88e10f04c88a5542234fbdfc1487e9c2f64058a05027c7c34fc4201153.\n```\n\nGoogle Chrome should now launch, and subsequent updates to the application will continue to work as long as the code signing certificate doesn’t change or expire.\n\nTo disable \"Lockdown\" mode:\n\n```console\n$ sudo defaults delete /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode\n```\n\nSee `/var/log/santa.log` to monitor ALLOW and DENY execution decisions.\n\nA log and configuration server for Santa is available in [Zentral](https://github.com/zentralopensource/zentral), an open source event monitoring solution and TLS server for osquery and Santa.\n\nZentral will support Santa in both MONITORING and LOCKDOWN operation mode. Clients need to be enrolled with a TLS connection to sync Santa Rules, all Santa events from endpoints are aggregated and logged back in Zentral. Santa events can trigger actions and notifications from within the Zentral Framework.\n\n**Note** Python, Bash and other interpreters are whitelisted (since they are signed by Apple's developer certificate), so Santa will not be able to block such scripts from executing. Thus, a potential non-binary program which disables Santa is a weakness (not vulnerability, since it is so by design) to take note of.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nDisable [Diagnostics & Usage Data](https://github.com/fix-macosx/fix-macosx/wiki/Diagnostics-&-Usage-Data).\n\nIf you want to play **music** or watch **videos**, use [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) which is free and open source.\n\nIf you want to use **torrents**, use [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/download/) which is free and open source (note: like all software, even open source projects, [malware may still find its way in](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/new-os-x-ransomware-keranger-infected-transmission-bittorrent-client-installer/)). You may also wish to use a block list to avoid peering with known bad hosts - see [Which is the best blocklist for Transmission](https://giuliomac.wordpress.com/2014/02/19/best-blocklist-for-transmission/) and [johntyree/3331662](https://gist.github.com/johntyree/3331662).\n\nManage default file handlers with [duti](http://duti.org/), which can be installed with `brew install duti`. One reason to manage extensions is to prevent auto-mounting of remote file systems in Finder (see [Protecting Yourself From Sparklegate](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/2016/02/apologies-sky-kinda-falling-protecting-yourself-from-sparklegate/)). Here are several recommended file handlers to manage:\n\n```console\n$ duti -s com.apple.Safari afp\n\n$ duti -s com.apple.Safari ftp\n\n$ duti -s com.apple.Safari nfs\n\n$ duti -s com.apple.Safari smb\n\n$ duti -s com.apple.TextEdit public.unix-executable\n```\n\nMonitor system logs with the **Console** application or `syslog -w` or `/usr/bin/log stream` commands.\n\nIn systems prior to macOS Sierra (10.12), enable the [tty_tickets flag](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/21/tty_tickets-option-now-on-by-default-for-macos-sierras-sudo-tool/) in `/etc/sudoers` to restrict the sudo session to the Terminal window/tab that started it. To do so, use `sudo visudo` and add the line `Defaults    tty_tickets`.\n\nSet your screen to lock as soon as the screensaver starts:\n\n```console\n$ defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1\n\n$ defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 0\n```\n\nExpose hidden files and Library folder in Finder:\n\n```console\n$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\n$ chflags nohidden ~/Library\n```\n\nShow all filename extensions (so that \"Evil.jpg.app\" cannot masquerade easily).\n\n```console\n$ defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true\n```\n\nDon't default to saving documents to iCloud:\n\n```console\n$ defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSDocumentSaveNewDocumentsToCloud -bool false\n```\n\nEnable [Secure Keyboard Entry](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/47749/how-secure-is-secure-keyboard-entry-in-mac-os-xs-terminal) in Terminal (unless you use [YubiKey](https://mig5.net/content/secure-keyboard-entry-os-x-blocks-interaction-yubikeys) or applications such as [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander/secureinput)).\n\nDisable crash reporter (the dialog which appears after an application crashes and prompts to report the problem to Apple):\n\n```console\n$ defaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none\n```\n\nDisable Bonjour [multicast advertisements](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/mDNS---Telling-the-world-about-you-(and-your-device)/):\n\n```console\n$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool YES\n```\n\n[Disable Handoff](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151481/why-is-my-macbook-visibile-on-bluetooth-after-yosemite-install) and Bluetooth features, if they aren't necessary.\n\nConsider [sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/sandbox-exec.1.html) your applications. See [fG! Sandbox Guide](https://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v0.1.pdf) (pdf) and [s7ephen/OSX-Sandbox--Seatbelt--Profiles](https://github.com/s7ephen/OSX-Sandbox--Seatbelt--Profiles).\n\nDid you know Apple has not shipped a computer with TPM since [2006](http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/chapter10/tpm/)?\n\nmacOS comes with this line in `/etc/sudoers`:\n\n```\nDefaults env_keep += \"HOME MAIL\"\n```\n\nWhich stops sudo from changing the HOME variable when you elevate privileges. This means it will execute as root the bash dotfiles in the non-root user's home directory when you run \"sudo bash\". It is advisable to comment this line out to avoid a potentially easy way for malware or a local attacker to escalate privileges to root.\n\nIf you want to retain the convenience of the root user having a non-root user's home directory, you can append an export line to /var/root/.bashrc, e.g.:\n\n```console\nexport HOME=/Users/blah\n```\n\nSet a [custom umask](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201684):\n\n```console\n$ sudo launchctl config user umask 077\n```\n\nReboot, create a file in Finder and verify its permissions (macOS default allows 'group/other' read access):\n\n```console\n$ ls -ld umask*\ndrwx------  2 kevin  staff       64 Dec  4 12:27 umask_testing_dir\n-rw-------@ 1 kevin  staff  2026566 Dec  4 12:28 umask_testing_file\n```\n\n## Related software\n\n* [CISOfy/lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis) - Cross-platform security auditing tool and assists with compliance testing and system hardening.\n* [Dylib Hijack Scanner](https://objective-see.com/products/dhs.html) - Scan for applications that are either susceptible to dylib hijacking or have been hijacked.\n* [F-Secure XFENCE](https://campaigns.f-secure.com/xfence/) (formerly [Little Flocker](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/pull/237)) - \"Little Snitch for files\"; prevents applications from accessing files.\n* [Lockdown](https://objective-see.com/products/lockdown.html) - Audits and remediates security configuration settings.\n* [Zentral](https://github.com/zentralopensource/zentral) - A log and configuration server for santa and osquery.

    "text" : "# free-for.dev\n\nDevelopers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.\n\nThis is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.\n\nThe scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.\n\nThis list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 1100+ people. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.\n\n[![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev)\n\n*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.\n\nTable of Contents\n=================\n\n   * [Major Cloud Providers' Always-Free Limits](#major-cloud-providers)\n   * [Cloud management solutions](#cloud-management-solutions)\n   * [Analytics, Events and Statistics](#analytics-events-and-statistics)\n   * [APIs, Data and ML](#apis-data-and-ml)\n   * [Artifact Repos](#artifact-repos)\n   * [BaaS](#baas)\n   * [CDN and Protection](#cdn-and-protection)\n   * [CI and CD](#ci-and-cd)\n   * [CMS](#cms)\n   * [Code Quality](#code-quality)\n   * [Code Search and Browsing](#code-search-and-browsing)\n   * [Crash and Exception Handling](#crash-and-exception-handling)\n   * [Data Visualization on Maps](#data-visualization-on-maps)\n   * [DBaaS](#dbaas)\n   * [Design and UI](#design-and-ui)\n   * [Design Inspiration](#design-inspiration)\n   * [Dev Blogging Sites](#dev-blogging-sites)\n   * [DNS](#dns)\n   * [Docker Related](#docker-related)\n   * [Domain](#domain)\n   * [Email](#email)\n   * [Font](#font)\n   * [Forms](#forms)\n   * [IaaS](#iaas)\n   * [IDE and Code Editing](#ide-and-code-editing)\n   * [International Mobile Number Verification API and SDK](#international-mobile-number-verification-api-and-sdk)\n   * [Issue Tracking and Project Management](#issue-tracking-and-project-management)\n   * [Log Management](#log-management)\n   * [Management Systems](#management-system)\n   * [Messaging and Streaming](#messaging-and-streaming)\n   * [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\n   * [Monitoring](#monitoring)\n   * [PaaS](#paas)\n   * [Package Build System](#package-build-system)\n   * [Payment and Billing Integration](#payment-and-billing-integration)\n   * [Privacy Management](#privacy-management)\n   * [Screenshot APIs](#screenshot-apis)\n   * [Search](#search)\n   * [Security and PKI](#security-and-pki)\n   * [Source Code Repos](#source-code-repos)\n   * [Storage and Media Processing](#storage-and-media-processing)\n   * [Tunneling, WebRTC, Web Socket Servers and Other Routers](#tunneling-webrtc-web-socket-servers-and-other-routers)\n   * [Testing](#testing)\n   * [Tools for Teams and Collaboration](#tools-for-teams-and-collaboration)\n   * [Translation Management](#translation-management)\n   * [Vagrant Related](#vagrant-related)\n   * [Visitor Session Recording](#visitor-session-recording)\n   * [Web Hosting](#web-hosting)\n   * [Commenting Platforms](#commenting-platforms)\n   * [Browser based hardware emulation](#browser-based-hardware-emulation-written-in-javascript)\n   * [Remote Desktop Tools](#remote-desktop-tools)\n   * [Other Free Resources](#other-free-resources)\n\n## Major Cloud Providers\n\n  * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)\n    * App Engine - 28 frontend instance hours per day, 9 backend instance hours per day\n    * Cloud Firestore - 1GB storage, 50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes per day\n    * Compute Engine - 1 non-preemptible e2-micro, 30GB HDD, 5GB snapshot storage (restricted to certain regions), 1 GB network egress from North America to all region destinations (excluding China and Australia) per month\n    * Cloud Storage - 5GB, 1GB network egress\n    * Cloud Shell - Web-based Linux shell/basic IDE with 5GB of persistent storage. 60 hours limit per week\n    * Cloud Pub/Sub - 10GB of messages per month\n    * Cloud Functions - 2 million invocations per month (includes both background and HTTP invocations)\n    * Cloud Run - 2 million requests per month, 360,000 GB-seconds memory, 180,000 vCPU-seconds of compute time, 1 GB network egress from North America per month\n    * Google Kubernetes Engine - No cluster management fee for one zonal cluster.

    "text" : "# Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and iOS\n\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fcm.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/fcm) [![Build Status](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/actions)\n\nThe FCM gem lets your ruby backend send notifications to Android and iOS devices via [\nFirebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/).\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ gem install fcm\n\nor in your `Gemfile` just include it:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'fcm'\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nFor Android you will need a device running 2.3 (or newer) that also have the Google Play Store app installed, or an emulator running Android 2.3 with Google APIs. iOS devices are also supported.\n\nA version of supported Ruby, currently:\n`ruby >= 2.4`\n\n## Usage\n\n## HTTP v1 API\n\nTo migrate to HTTP v1 see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1\n\n```ruby\nfcm = FCM.new(\n  API_TOKEN,\n  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_PATH,\n  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID\n)\nmessage = {\n  'topic': \"89023\", # OR token if you want to send to a specific device\n  # 'token': \"000iddqd\",\n  'data': {\n    payload: {\n      data: {\n        id: 1\n      }\n    }.to_json\n  },\n  'notification': {\n    title: notification.title_th,\n    body: notification.body_th,\n  },\n  'android': {},\n  'apns': {\n    payload: {\n      aps: {\n        sound: \"default\",\n        category: \"#{Time.zone.now.to_i}\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  'fcm_options': {\n    analytics_label: 'Label'\n  }\n}\n\nfcm.send_v1(message)\n```\n\n## HTTP Legacy Version\n\nTo migrate to HTTP v1 see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1\n\nFor your server to send a message to one or more devices, you must first initialise a new `FCM` class with your Firebase Cloud Messaging server key, and then call the `send` method on this and give it 1 or more (up to 1000) registration tokens as an array of strings. You can also optionally send further [HTTP message parameters](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref) like `data` or `time_to_live` etc. as a hash via the second optional argument to `send`.\n\nExample sending notifications:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'fcm'\n\nfcm = FCM.new(\"my_server_key\")\n\nregistration_ids= [\"12\", \"13\"] # an array of one or more client registration tokens\n\n# See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref for all available options.\noptions = { \"notification\": {\n              \"title\": \"Portugal vs. Denmark\",\n              \"body\": \"5 to 1\"\n          }\n}\nresponse = fcm.send(registration_ids, options)\n```\n\nCurrently `response` is just a hash containing the response `body`, `headers` and `status_code`. Check [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server#response) to see how to interpret the responses.\n\n## Device Group Messaging\n\nWith [device group messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/notifications), you can send a single message to multiple instance of an app running on devices belonging to a group. Typically, \"group\" refers a set of different devices that belong to a single user. However, a group could also represent a set of devices where the app instance functions in a highly correlated manner. To use this feature, you will first need an initialised `FCM` class.\n\n### Generate a Notification Key for device group\n\nThen you will need a notification key which you can create for a particular `key_name` which needs to be uniquely named per app in case you have multiple apps for the same `project_id`. This ensures that notifications only go to the intended target app. The `create` method will do this and return the token `notification_key`, that represents the device group, in the response:\n\n```ruby\nparams = {key_name: \"appUser-Chris\",\n                project_id: \"my_project_id\",\n                registration_ids: [\"4\", \"8\", \"15\", \"16\", \"23\", \"42\"]}\nresponse = fcm.create(*params.values)\n```\n\n### Send to Notification Key\n\nNow you can send a message to a particular `notification_key` via the `send_with_notification_key` method. This allows the server to send a single [data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#data_messages) payload or/and [notification](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications) payload to multiple app instances (typically on multiple devices) owned by a single user (instead of sending to some registration tokens). Note: the maximum number of members allowed for a `notification_key` is 20.\n\n```ruby\nresponse = fcm.send_with_notification_key(\"notification_key\",\n            data: {score: \"3x1\"},\n            collapse_key: \"updated_score\")\n```\n\n### Add/Remove Registration Tokens\n\nYou can also add/remove registration Tokens to/from a particular `notification_key` of some `project_id`. For example:\n\n```ruby\nparams = { key_name: \"appUser-Chris\",\n                project_id: \"my_project_id\",\n                notification_key:\"appUser-Chris-key\",\n                registration_ids:[\"7\", \"3\"] }\nresponse = fcm.add(*params.values)\n\nparams = { key_name: \"appUser-Chris\",\n                project_id: \"my_project_id\",\n                notification_key:\"appUser-Chris-key\",\n                registration_ids:[\"8\", \"15\"] }\nresponse = fcm.remove(*params.values)\n```\n\n## Send Messages to Topics\n\nFCM [topic messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/topic-messaging) allows your app server to send a message to multiple devices that have opted in to a particular topic. Based on the publish/subscribe model, topic messaging supports unlimited subscriptions per app. Sending to a topic is very similar to sending to an individual device or to a user group, in the sense that you can use the `fcm.send_with_notification_key()` method where the `notification_key` matches the regular expression `\"/topics/[a-zA-Z0-9-_.~%]+\"`:\n\n```ruby\nresponse = fcm.send_with_notification_key(\"/topics/yourTopic\",\n            notification: {body: \"This is a FCM Topic Message!\"})\n```\n\nOr you can use the helper:\n\n```ruby\nresponse = fcm.send_to_topic(\"yourTopic\",\n            notification: {body: \"This is a FCM Topic Message!\"})\n```\n\n### Sending to Multiple Topics\n\nTo send to combinations of multiple topics, the FCM [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message#send_messages_to_topics_2) require that you set a **condition** key (instead of the `to:` key) to a boolean condition that specifies the target topics. For example, to send messages to devices that subscribed to _TopicA_ and either _TopicB_ or _TopicC_:\n\n```\n'TopicA' in topics && ('TopicB' in topics || 'TopicC' in topics)\n```\n\nFCM first evaluates any conditions in parentheses, and then evaluates the expression from left to right. In the above expression, a user subscribed to any single topic does not receive the message. Likewise, a user who does not subscribe to TopicA does not receive the message. These combinations do receive it:\n\n- TopicA and TopicB\n- TopicA and TopicC\n\nYou can include up to five topics in your conditional expression, and parentheses are supported. Supported operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`. Note the usage for !:\n\n```\n!('TopicA' in topics)\n```\n\nWith this expression, any app instances that are not subscribed to TopicA, including app instances that are not subscribed to any topic, receive the message.\n\nThe `send_to_topic_condition` method within this library allows you to specicy a condition of multiple topics to which to send to the data payload.\n\n```ruby\nresponse = fcm.send_to_topic_condition(\n  \"'TopicA' in topics && ('TopicB' in topics || 'TopicC' in topics)\",\n  notification: {\n    body: \"This is an FCM Topic Message sent to a condition!\"\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## Subscribe the client app to a topic\n\nGiven a registration token and a topic name, you can add the token to the topic using the [Google Instance ID server API](https://developers.google.com/instance-id/reference/server).\n\n```ruby\ntopic = \"YourTopic\"\nregistration_id= \"12\" # a client registration tokens\nresponse = fcm.topic_subscription(topic, registration_id)\n```\n\nOr you can manage relationship maps for multiple app instances [Google Instance ID server API. Manage relationship](https://developers.google.com/instance-id/reference/server#manage_relationship_maps_for_multiple_app_instances)\n\n```ruby\ntopic = \"YourTopic\"\nregistration_ids= [\"4\", \"8\", \"15\", \"16\", \"23\", \"42\"] # an array of one or more client registration tokens\nresponse = fcm.batch_topic_subscription(topic, registration_ids)\n# or unsubscription\nresponse = fcm.batch_topic_unsubscription(topic, registration_ids)\n```\n\n## Mobile Clients\n\nYou can find a guide to implement an Android Client app to receive notifications here: [Set up a FCM Client App on Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client).\n\nThe guide to set up an iOS app to get notifications is here: [Setting up a FCM Client App on iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client).\n\n## ChangeLog\n\n### 1.0.8\n- caches calls to `Google::Auth::ServiceAccountCredentials` #103\n- Allow `faraday` versions from 1 up to 2  #101\n\n### 1.0.7\n\n- Fix passing `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` to `faraday` [#96](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/pull/96)\n- Fix issue with `get_instance_id_info` option params [#98](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/pull/98)\n- Accept any IO object for credentials [#95](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/pull/94)\n\nHuge thanks to @excid3 @jsparling @jensljungblad\n\n### 1.0.3\n\n- Fix overly strict faraday dependency\n\n### 1.0.2\n\n- Bug fix: retrieve notification key\" params: https://github.com/spacialdb/fcm/commit/b328a75c11d779a06d0ceda83527e26aa0495774\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n- Bumped supported ruby to `>= 2.4`\n- Fix deprecation warnings from `faraday` by changing dependency version to `faraday 1.0.0`\n\n### 0.0.7\n\n- replace `httparty` with `faraday`\n\n### 0.0.2\n\n- Fixed group messaging url.\n- Added API to `recover_notification_key`.\n\n\n### 0.0.1\n\n- Initial version.\n\n## MIT License\n\n- Copyright (c) 2016 Kashif Rasul and Shoaib Burq.

    "text" : "# org-caldav\n\nCaldav sync for Emacs Orgmode\n\n**Minimum Emacs version needed**: 26.3\n\n\nCalDAV servers:\n\n* **Owncloud** and **Nextcloud**: Regularly tested.\n\n* **Google Calendar**: Should work, but you need to register an\napplication with the Google Developer Console for OAuth2\nauthentication (see below), because Google explicitly forbids to put\nclient id/secrets into open source software (see\nhttps://developers.google.com/terms, section 4b, paragraph 1). Instead\nof doing that though, I'd rather suggest you choose another service\nprovider.\n\n* **Radicale** and **Baikal**: Should work. If you get problems with\n'Digest' authentication, switch back to 'Basic' (make sure to use\nhttps, though!). If you get asked for password repeatedly, put it in\n.authinfo file (see below).\n\n* **SOGo** and **Kolab**: Reported to be working\n    (https://kolabnow.com/clients/emacs)\n\nNote that Emacs releases <26.3 might not correctly handle https via\nTLSv1.3 (see https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34341). If\nyou see errors like \"Bad request\" or \"No data received\" you can either\ntry to set\n\n    (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority \"NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3\")\n\t\nor you upgrade to Emacs 26.3.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Before using this code, please make sure you have backups\nof your precious Org files. Also, I strongly suggest to create a new,\nempty calendar on your server for using this package.\n\n**ALSO IMPORTANT**: When using this package, possibly all Org entries\nwill get an UID property (see doc-string of org-icalendar-store-UID\nfor further details). If you don't want this, then *do not use this\npackage*; there is just no way around that. It is the only reliable\nway to uniquely identify Org entries.\n\n### IN A NUTSHELL\n\n* Create a new calendar; the name does not matter.\n\n* Set `org-caldav-url` to the base address of your CalDAV server:\n    - Owncloud/Nextcloud (9.x and above): https://OWNCLOUD-SERVER-URL/remote.php/dav/calendars/USERID\n    - Google: Set to symbol 'google. See below for further documentation.\n\n* Set `org-caldav-calendar-id` to the calendar-id of your new\ncalendar:\n    - Own/NextCloud: Click on that little symbol next to the calendar\n      name and inspect the link of the calendar; the last element of\n      the shown path is the calendar-id. This should *usually* be the\n      same as the name of the calendar, but not necessarily: Owncloud\n      might replace certain characters (upper- to lowercase, for\n      instance), or it might even be entirely different if the\n      calendar was created by another CalDAV application.\n    - Google: Click on 'calendar settings' and the id will be shown\n      next to \"Calendar Address\". It is of the form\n      `ID@group.calendar.google.com`. Do *not* omit the domain!\n\n* Set `org-caldav-inbox` to an org filename where new entries from the\n  calendar should be stored. Just to be safe, I suggest using an\n  empty, dedicated Org file for that.\n\n* Set `org-caldav-files` to the list of org files you would like to\n  sync. The above `org-caldav-inbox` will be automatically added, so you\n  don't have to add it here.\n\n* It is usually a good idea to manually set `org-icalendar-timezone` to\n  the timezone of your remote calendar. It should be a simple string\n  like \"Europe/Berlin\". If that doesn't work and your events are\n  shifted by a few hours, try the setting \"UTC\" (the SOGo calendar\n  server seems to need this).\n\nPlease note that org-caldav does not directly control how and which\nentries are exported, it just uses the org-icalendar\nexporter. Therefore, you should also take a look at the options from\nthe org-icalendar exporter. Most importantly, take a look at\n`org-icalendar-alarm-time` to add a reminder to your entries, and\n`org-icalendar-use-deadline` and `org-icalendar-use-scheduled` to control\nwhich timestamps should be used.\n\nCall `org-caldav-sync` to start the sync. The URL package will ask you\nfor username/password for accessing the calendar. (See below on how to\nstore that password in an authinfo file.)\n\nThe first sync can easily take several minutes, depending on the\nnumber of calendar items. Especially Google's CalDAV interface is\npretty slow. If you have to abort the initial sync for some reason,\njust start `org-caldav-sync` again in the same Emacs session and you\nshould get asked if you'd like to resume.\n\nThe same goes for sync errors you might get. Especially when using\nGoogle Calendar, it is not unusual to get stuff like '409' errors\nduring the initial sync. Only Google knows why. Just run\n`org-caldav-sync` again until all events are uploaded.\n\n### Syncing to Google Calendar\n\nThe new CalDAV endpoint for Google Calendar requires OAuth2\nauthentication.  So first, you need to install the oauth2 library from\nGNU ELPA, and afterwards you need to acquire an application ID and\nsecret from the Google Developer Console. For details on how to do\nthis, follow the Google documentation at\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/caldav/v2/guide#creating_your_client_id\n\nPut the client ID and secret into `org-caldav-oauth2-client-id` and\n`org-caldav-oauth2-client-secret`, respectively. Then set `org-caldav-url`\nto the symbol 'google, and look up the `org-caldav-calendar-id` as\ndescribed above.\n\nOn first connection, the oauth2 library should redirect you to the\nGoogle OAuth2 authentication site. This requires a javascript enabled\nbrowser, so make sure that `browse-url-browser-function` is set to\nsomething like `browse-url-firefox` (the internal shr or w3m browser\nwill **not** work). After authentication, you will be given a key that\nyou have to paste into the Emacs prompt. The oauth2 library will save\nthis key in Emacs' secure plist store, which is encrypted with\nGnuPG. If you have not yet used a secure plist store, you will be\nasked for its encryption passphrase. In the future, you should only\nneed to enter that passphrase again to connect with Google Calendar.\n\nBy default, plstore will **not** cache your entered password, so it\nwill possibly ask you **many** times. To activate caching, use\n\n    (setq plstore-cache-passphrase-for-symmetric-encryption t)\n\n### DETAILS\n\nCompared to earlier versions of this package from 2012, it now does\nproper two-way syncing, that means it does not matter where and how\nyou change an entry. You can also move Org entries freely from one\nfile to another, as long as they are all listed in\n`org-caldav-files`. The org-icalendar package will put a unique ID on\neach entry with an active timestamp, so that org-caldav can find\nit. It will also sync deletions, but more on that later.\n\nYou can also return to the simpler version which only does one-way\nsyncing. Simply set `org-caldav-sync-direction` to `'org->cal` or\n`'cal->org`, depending on which direction you'd like to have. If you\nchoose `'org->cal`, then `org-caldav-inbox` won't matter and can be\n`nil`. Likewise, if you choose `'cal->org`, then `org-caldav-files`\nwill be ignored and only the calendar will be imported into the inbox.\n\n#### Org and the iCalendar format\n\nAn Org entry can store much more information than an iCalendar entry,\nso there is no one-to-one correspondence between the two formats which\nmakes syncing a bit difficult.\n\n* Org to iCalendar\n\nThis package uses the org-icalendar package to do the export to the\niCalendar format (.ics files). By default, it uses the title of the\nOrg entry as SUMMARY and puts the entry's body into DESCRIPTION,\nsnipping stuff like properties and timestamps (you can override that\nwith properties of the same name, but IMO it makes stuff just more\ncomplicated). The variable `org-icalendar-include-body`\ndenotes how many characters from the body should be included as\nDESCRIPTION (by default all characters are included).\n\n* iCalendar to Org\n\nIf you create a new iCalendar entry in your calendar, you'll get an\nOrg entry with SUMMARY as heading, DESCRIPTION as body and the\ntimestamp. However, if you *change* an existing entry in the calendar,\nthings get more complicated and the variable\n`org-caldav-sync-changes-to-org` comes into play. Its default is the\nsymbol \"title-and-timestamp\", which means that only the entry's\nheading is synced (with SUMMARY) and the timestamp gets updated, but\n*not* the entry's body with DESCRIPTION.  The simple reason is that\nyou might loose data, since DESCRIPTION is rather limited in what it\ncan store. Still, you can set the variable to the symbol \"all\", which\nwill completely *replace* an existing Org entry with the entry that\ngets generated from the calendar's event. You can also limit syncing\nto heading and/or timestamp only.\n\nTo be extra safe, org-caldav will by default backup entries it\nchanges. See the variable `org-caldav-backup-file` for details.\n\n* Org sexp entries\n\nA special case are sexp entries like\n\n    %%(diary-anniversary  2 2 1969) Foo's birthday\n    \n    * Regular meeting\n      <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>\n\nAs you can see, they can appear in two different ways: plain by\nthemselves, or inside an Org entry. If they are inside an Org entry,\nthere's a good chance they will be exported (see below) and have an ID\nproperty, so they can be found by org-caldav. We can sync the title,\nbut syncing the timestamp with the s-expression is just infeasible, so\nthis will generate a sync error (which are *not* critical; you'll just\nsee them at the end of the sync, just so that you're aware that some\nstuff wasn't synced properly).\n\nHowever, sexp-entries are insanely flexible, and there are limits as\nto what the icalendar exporter will handle. For example, this here\n\n    ** Regular event\n       <%%(memq (calendar-day-of-week date) '(1 3 5))>\n\nwill not be exported at all.\n\nIf the sexp entry is not inside an Org entry but stands by itself,\nthey still will be exported, but they won't get an ID (since IDs are\nproperties linked to Org entries). In practice, that means that you\ncan delete and change them inside Org and this will be synced, but if\nyou *change* them in the *calendar*, this will *not* get synced\nback. Org-caldav just cannot find those entries, so this will generate\na one-time sync error instead (again: those are not critical, just\nFYI). If you don't want those entries to be exported at all, just set\n`org-icalendar-include-sexps` to nil.\n\n#### Filtering entries\n\nThere are several possibilities to choose which entries should be\nsynced and which not:\n\n* If you only want to sync manually marked entries, use\n  `org-caldav-select-tags`, which is directly mapped to\n  `org-export-select-tags`, so see its doc-string on how it works.\n\n* If you want to exclude certain tags, use `org-caldav-exclude-tags`,\n  which is mapped to `org-icalendar-exclude` tags.\n\n* If you want more fine grained control, use\n  `org-caldav-skip-conditions`. The syntax of the conditions is\n  described in the doc-string of `org-agenda-skip-if`.\n\nNote however that the normal `org-agenda-skip-function(-global)` will\n**not** have any effect on the icalendar exporter (this used to be the\ncase, but changed with the new exporters).\n\n#### Syncing deletions\n\nIf you delete entries in your Org files, the corresponding iCalendar\nentries will by default get deleted. You can change that behavior with\n`org-caldav-delete-calendar-entries` to never delete, or to ask before\ndeletion.\n\nYou must be careful to not simply remove previously synced files from\n`org-caldav-files`, as org-caldav would view all the entries from those\nfiles as deleted and hence by default also delete them from the\ncalendar.  However, org-caldav should be able to detect this situation\nand warn you with the message 'Previously synced file(s) are missing',\nasking you whether to continue nonetheless.\n\nIf you delete events in your calendar, you will by default get asked\nif you'd like to delete the corresponding Org event. You can change\nthat behavior through `org-caldav-delete-org-entries`.\n\nIf you answer a deletion request with \"no\", the event should get\nre-synced to the calendar next time you call `org-caldav-sync`.\n\n#### Conflict handling\n\nNow that's an easy one: Org always wins. That means, if you change an\nentry in Org *and* in the calendar, the changes in the calendar will\nbe lost. I might implement proper conflict handling some day, but\ndon't hold your breath (patches are welcome, of course).\n\n#### Storing authentication information in authinfo/netrc\n\nIf you don't want to enter your user/password every time, you can\nstore it permanently in an authinfo file. In Emacs, the auth-source\npackage takes care of that, but the syntax for https authentication is\na bit peculiar. You have to use a line like the following\n\n    machine www.google.com:443 port https login username password secret\n\nNote that you have to specify the port number in the URL and *also*\nspecify 'https' for the port. This is not a bug. For more information,\nsee (info \"auth\"), especially section \"Help for users\".\n\nSince you are storing your password in a file you should encrypt it\nusing GnuPG. Emacs will prompt you for a decryption key when it tries\nto read the file.\n\n#### Storage of sync information and sync from different computers\n\nThe current sync state is stored in a file `org-caldav-SOMEID.el` in\nthe ~/.emacs.d directory. You can change the location through the\nvariable `org-caldav-save-directory`. SOMEID directly depends on the\ncalendar id (it's a snipped MD5).\n\nIf you sync your Org files across different machines and want to use\norg-caldav on all of them, don't forget to sync the org sync state,\ntoo. Probably your best bet is to set `org-caldav-save-directory` to the\npath you have your Org files in, so that it gets copied alongside with\nthem.\n\n#### Starting from scratch\n\nIf your sync state somehow gets broken, you can make a clean slate by\ndoing\n\n    C-u M-x org-caldav-delete-everything\n\nThe function has to be called with a prefix so that you don't call it\nby accident. This will delete everything in the calendar along with\nthe current sync state. You can then call `org-caldav-sync` afterwards\nand it will completely put all Org events into the now empty\ncalendar. Needless to say, don't do that if you have new events in\nyour calendar which are not synced yet...\n\nDeleting many events can be slow, though; in that case, just delete\nthe calendar and re-create it, delete the sync state file in\n~/.emacs.d and restart Emacs.\n\n#### Syncing with more than one calendar\n\nThis can be done by setting the variable `org-caldav-calendars`. It\nshould be a list of plists (a 'plist' is simply a list with alternating\n:key's and values). Through these plists, you can override the global\nvalues of variables like `org-caldav-calendar-id`, and calling\n`org-caldav-sync` will go through these plists in order.\n\nExample:\n\n    (setq org-caldav-calendars\n      '((:calendar-id \"work@whatever\" :files (\"~/org/work.org\")\n         :inbox \"~/org/fromwork.org\")\n        (:calendar-id \"stuff@mystuff\"\n         :files (\"~/org/sports.org\" \"~/org/play.org\")\n         :skip-conditions (regexp \"soccer\")\n         :inbox \"~/org/fromstuff.org\")) )\n\nThis means that you have two calendars with IDs \"work@whatever\" and\n\"stuff@mystuff\". Both will be accessed through the global value of\norg-caldav-url, since the key :url isn't specified. The calendar\n\"work@whatever\" will be synced with the file 'work.org' and inbox\n'fromwork.org', while \"stuff@mystuff\" with 'sports.org' and\n'play.org', *unless* there's the string 'soccer' in the heading, and\nand inbox is 'fromstuff.org'. See the doc-string of\n`org-caldav-calendars` for more details on which keys you can use.\n\n#### Additional stuff\n\nSee the doc-string of `org-caldav-inbox` if you want more flexibility in\nwhere new items should be put. Instead of simply providing a file, you\ncan also choose an existing entry or headline.\n\n#### Timezone problems\n\nTimezone handling is plain horrible, and it seems every CalDAV server\ndoes it slightly differently, also using non-standard headers like\nX-WR-TIMEZONE. If you see items being shifted by a few hours, make\nreally really sure you have properly set `org-icalendar-timezone`, and\nthat your calendar is configured to use the same one.\n\nIf it still does not work, you can try setting `org-icalendar-timezone`\nto the string \"UTC\". This will put all events using UTC times and the\nserver should transpose the time to the timezone you have set in your\ncalendar preferences. For some servers (like SOGo) this might work\nbetter than setting a \"real\" timezone.\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nIf org-caldav reports a problem with the given URL, please\ntriple-check that the URL is correct. It must point to a valid\ncalendar on your CalDAV server.\n\nIf the error is that the URL does not seem to accept DAV requests, you\ncan additionally check with 'curl' by doing\n\n     curl -D - -X OPTIONS --basic -u mylogin:mypassword URL\n\nThe output of this command must contain a 'DAV' header like this:\n\n    DAV: 1, 3, extended-mkcol, access-control, ... etc. ...\n\nBy default, org-caldav will put all kinds of debug output into the\nbuffer \\*org-caldav-debug\\*. Look there if you're getting sync errors\nor if something plain doesn't work. If you're using an authinfo file\nand authentication doesn't work, set auth-info-debug to t and look in\nthe \\*Messages\\* buffer. When you report a bug, please try to post the\nrelevant portion of the \\*org-caldav-debug\\* buffer since it might be\nhelpful to see what's going wrong. If Emacs throws an error, do\n\n    M-x toggle-debug-on-error\n\nand try to replicate the error to get a backtrace.\n\nYou can also turn on excessive debugging by setting the variable\n`org-caldav-debug-level` to 2. This will also output the *contents* of\nthe events into the debug buffer. If you send such a buffer in a bug\nreport, please make very sure you have removed personal information\nfrom those events.\n\n#### Known Bugs\n\n* Recurring events created or changed on the calendar side cannot be\n  synced (they will work fine as long as you manage them in Org,\n  though).\n\n* Syncing is currently pretty slow since everything is done\n  synchronously.\n\n* Pretty much everything besides SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION and\n  time is ignored in iCalendar.\n\n#### How syncing happens (a.k.a. my little CalDAV rant)\n\n(This is probably not interesting, so you can just stop reading.)\n\nCalDAV is a mess.\n\nFirst off, it is based on WebDAV, which has its own fair share of\nproblems. The main design flaw of CalDAV however, is that UID and\nresource name (the \"filename\", if you want) are two different\nthings. I know that there are reasons for that (not everything has a\nUID, like timezones, and you can put several events in one resource),\nbut this is typical over-engineering to allow some marginal use cases\npretty much no one needs. Another problem is that you have to do\nadditional round-trips to get Etag and sequence number, which makes\nCalDAV pretty slow.\n\nOrg-caldav takes the easy route: it assumes that every resource\ncontains one event, and that UID and resource name are identical. In\nfact, Google's CalDAV interface even enforces the latter. And while\nOwncloud does not enforce it, at least it just does it if you create\nitems in its web interface.\n\nHowever, the CalDAV standard does not demand this, so I guess there\nare servers out there with which org-caldav does not work. Patches\nwelcome.\n\nNow, all this would be bad enough if it weren't for the sloppy server\nimplementations which make implementing a CalDAV client a living hell\nand led to several rewrites of the code. Especially Google, the 500\npound gorilla in the room, doesn't really care much for CalDAV. I\nguess they really like their own shiny REST-based calendar API better,\nand I can't blame them for that.\n"

This returns Google reCAPTCHA Response object.\n- setScore() is optional only if you want to manually verify the score.\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n``` php\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::setAction($action)->verifyResponse($value,$ip = null);\n```\n\n``` php\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::verifyResponse($value,$ip)->getMessage();\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::verifyResponse($value)->isSuccess();\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::verifyResponse($value)->toArray();\n```\n\n\n``` php\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::verifyResponse(\n                         $request->input('g-recaptcha-response'),\n                         $request->getClientIp()\n                         )\n                      ->getMessage()\n```\n\n\n``` php\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::setAction($action)->verifyResponse($value)->isSuccess();\n ```\n\nIf you manually assign a value to setScore($score), the code will fully skip your config file and force to check the score.\n\n``` php\n   GoogleReCaptchaV3::setScore($score)\n                    ->setAction($action)\n                    ->verifyResponse(\n                        $request->input('g-recaptcha-response'),\n                        $request->getClientIp()\n                        )\n                    ->getMessage()\n```\n\n\n## Validation Class (Only support Laravel >= 5.5) <a name=\"validation-class\" />\n\n   You can use provided Validation object to verify your reCAPTCHA.\n\n``` php\n   use TimeHunter\\LaravelGoogleReCaptchaV3\\Validations\\GoogleReCaptchaV3ValidationRule;\n   $rule = [\n            'g-recaptcha-response' => [new GoogleReCaptchaV3ValidationRule('action_name')]\n        ];\n```\n\n   -  $actionName: if its NULL, the package won't verify action with google response.\n\n\n\n## Blade Usage <a name=\"blade-basic-usage\" />\n\n### Display reCAPTCHA v3\n\n#### Add Google API script\n\nInclude the API script at the bottom of your layout page\n\n``` html\n  {!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::init() !!}\n```\n##### Consent Security Policy - Nonce\n\nTo add a nonce for content security, pass a params array with your pages nonce. \n\n``` html\n  {!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::init([\n    'nonce' => nonce(),\n  ]) !!}\n```\n\n#### Running script on every page (optional)\n\nIt's recommended to include reCAPTCHA v3 on every page which can help you get the most context about interactions for analytics. You just need to enable the config:\n\n``` php\n   ...\n  'background_badge_display' => true, // if false, the badge will be invisible, if true the badge shows at bottom right.\n  'background_mode' => false, // if true, the script will run on every page (ensure that GoogleReCaptchaV3::init() is placed on layout or homepage)\n   ...\n```\nIf the page has not detected any Action or duplicate google script, the background mode will be enabled.\n\n#### Form & Action\n\nThere are three methods to populate the reCAPTCHA within the form.\n\n- render() and renderOne() can be placed in anywhere but before init()\n- renderField() needs always to be placed within your form.\n\nMethod one - render():\n\n```\n[\n    $id=>$action , $id=>$action ...\n]\n\n{!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::render(['contact_us_id'=>'contact_us', 'signup_id'=>'signup']) !!}\n```\n\n``` html\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/verify\">\n    <div id=\"contact_us_id\"></div> // add div with id\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/verify\">\n    <div id=\"signup_id\"></div>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n{!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::render(['contact_us_id'=>'contact_us', 'signup_id'=>'signup']) !!}\n\n```\n\nMethod two - renderOne():\n\n```\nGoogleReCaptchaV3::renderOne($id,$action);\n\n{!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::renderOne('contact_us_id','contact_us') !!}\n```\n\n``` html\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/verify\">\n    <div id=\"contact_us_id\"></div> // add div with id\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n{!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::renderOne('contact_us_id','contact_us') !!}\n\n```\n\n\nMethod three - renderField():\n\n```\nGoogleReCaptchaV3::renderField($id,$action,$class,$style)\n\n{!! GoogleReCaptchaV3::renderField('contact_us_id','contact_us_action') !!}\n```\n\n\n``` html\n\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/verify\">\n   {!!  GoogleReCaptchaV3::renderField('contact_us_id','contact_us_action') !!}\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\n\n```\n\n### Badge Display for Form & Action\n\nIf your settings were not reflected, please run php artisan config:cache to clear cache.\n\nInline\n\n1. Go to config file, and set\n``` PHP\n    [\n        ...\n        'inline' => true\n        ...\n    ]\n```\n2. Badge will be displayed as inline format within the form.\n\n\nInvisible\n\n1. Set inline as true as well\n2. Modify your div with style display:none\n3. Refer to Google official site: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq\n, you need to include the following text:\n ``` HTML\n    This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n        <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a> and\n        <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a> apply.\n ```\n\nCorner\n\n1. Set inline as false\n2. Your badge will be shown in the bottom right side.\n\nCustom\n\n1. Set inline as true\n2. Do Styling/CSS on its div element\n\n### Ajax Usage - Refresh reCAPTCHA Response <a name=\"ajax-usage\" />\n\nThe package provides two handy Javascript functions for you to get recaptcha response and refresh recaptcha as needed.\n\n- refreshReCaptchaV3(fieldId,actionName) - this function will reset the response whenever your ajax response is returned.\n\n- getReCaptchaV3Response - this function helps you to get recaptcha response by id\n\nFor example:\n\n````html\n       <script>\n            $(\"#test\").click(function (e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                $.ajax({\n                    type: 'POST',\n                    url: '/verify',\n                    data: {\n                        'g-recaptcha-response':getReCaptchaV3Response('contact_id')\n                    },\n                    success: function (data) {\n                        refreshReCaptchaV3('contact_id','contact');\n                    },\n                    error: function(err){\n                        refreshReCaptchaV3('contact_id','contact');\n                    }\n                });\n            });\n      </script>\n````\n## Vue Usage (Package version >= 2.2.0) <a name=\"vue-usage\" />\n\nThe package provides a lightweight vue component. You need to publish the vue component before playing around it.\n\n### Step 1 Publish vue component:\n```sh\n$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"TimeHunter\\LaravelGoogleReCaptchaV3\\Providers\\GoogleReCaptchaV3ServiceProvider\" --tag=googlerecaptchav3.vuejs\n```\n\nThe file will be created under js/components/googlerecaptchav3/GoogleReCaptchaV3.vue, you have full control and modification ability on this file.\n\n\n### Step 2 Import vue component and Register reCAPTCHA v3 SiteKey\n\n#### A BIG thanks to [@Fluxlicious](https://github.com/Fluxlicious) who improved the vue component.\n\nThe Blade way is no longer useful if you use Vue. We need to manage to assign site key by ourselves. The component supports props below:\n\nSupported: siteKey, id, inline and action, check the original file to see the details.\n\n````vue\n<google-re-captcha-v3\n  v-model=\"gRecaptchaResponse\"\n  ref=\"captcha\"\n  site-key=\"Your Site Key String Here\"\n  id=\"contact_us_id\"\n  inline\n  action=\"contact_us\"\n></google-re-captcha-v3>\n\n````\n\n\nThere are two ways you can bind site key to the component.\n\n### Use prop\n\n````vue\n<template>\n    <div>\n        <form @submit.prevent=\"submit\">\n            <div>\n                <google-re-captcha-v3\n                  v-model=\"form.gRecaptchaResponse\"\n                  ref=\"captcha\"\n                  :site-key=\"mySiteKeyVariable\"\n                  id=\"contact_us_id\"\n                  inline\n                  action=\"contact_us\"\n                ></google-re-captcha-v3>\n            </div>\n            <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n        </form>\n    </div>\n</template>\n<script>\n    import GoogleReCaptchaV3 from '../../components/googlerecaptchav3/GoogleReCaptchaV3';\n    // location might be diff to your case, ensure that your component location is right\n\n    export default {\n        components: {\n            GoogleReCaptchaV3\n        },\n        data() {\n            return {\n                form: {\n                    gRecaptchaResponse: null\n                },\n                mySiteKeyVariable: 'Your Site Key String',\n            }\n        },\n        methods: {\n            submit() {\n                axios.post('/verify', this.form).then(\n                    response => {\n                        this.$refs.captcha.execute(); // every time you submit, the reCAPTCHA token needs to be refreshed\n                    }\n                ).catch(\n                    error => {\n                        this.$refs.captcha.execute(); // every time you submit, the reCAPTCHA token needs to be refreshed\n                    });\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n\n````\n\nPlease remember to refresh token every time you submit the form if needed:\n\n````vue\n this.$refs.captcha.execute();\n````\n\n###  or Add site key directly into GoogleReCaptchaV3 component\n\nAlternatively, I believe most of cases your site key will never be changed, so you could just modify the original published component to have sitekey hard-coded in.\n\nFor instance, open published file and find code below:\n````vue\n        ....\n        siteKey: {\n                  type: String,\n                  required: false, // set to true if you don't want to store the siteKey in this component\n                  default: 'Your Site Key Here' // set siteKey here if you want to store it in this component\n              },\n       ....\n\n````\n\n\n## Advanced Usage <a name=\"advanced-usage\" />\n\n### Custom implementation on Config\n\nFor some users, they might store the config details in their own storage e.g database. You can create your own class and implement:\n\n```\nTimeHunter\\LaravelGoogleReCaptchaV3\\Interfaces\\ReCaptchaConfigV3Interface\n```\n\nRemember to register it in your own service provider\n\n``` php\n     $this->app->bind(\n                ReCaptchaConfigV3Interface::class,\n                YourOwnCustomImplementation::class\n            );\n```\n\n### Custom implementation on Request method\n\nThe package has two default options to verify: Guzzle and Curl, if you want to use your own request method, You can create your own class and implement\n```\nTimeHunter\\LaravelGoogleReCaptchaV3\\Interfaces\\RequestClientInterface\n```\n\nRemember to register it in your own service provider\n``` php\n     $this->app->bind(\n                RequestClientInterface::class,\n                YourOwnCustomImplementation::class\n            );\n```\n\n\n## Contributors  <a name=\"contributors\" />\n\nThank you for the following contributors, You guys are the BEST!\n\n* [@xalunda](https://github.com/xalunda)\n* [@Fluxlicious](https://github.com/Fluxlicious)\n* [@vinsonyung](https://github.com/vinsonyung)\n* [@demiurge-ash](https://github.com/demiurge-ash)\n* [@lxlang](https://github.com/lxlang)\n* [@Indianos](https://github.com/Indianos)\n* [@ericp-mrel](https://github.com/ericp-mrel)\n* [@QuentinBontemps](https://github.com/QuentinBontemps)\n* [@alr2413](https://github.com/alr2413)\n\n\n## Security\n\nIf you discover any security related issues, please email ryandadeng@gmail.com instead of using the issue tracker.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT.

    "text" : "Dailymotion Player SDK Android\n===========================\n[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/dailymotion/com.dailymotion.dailymotion-sdk-android/sdk/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/dailymotion/com.dailymotion.dailymotion-sdk-android/sdk/_latestVersion)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dailymotion/dailymotion-player-sdk-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dailymotion/dailymotion-player-sdk-android)\n\nOur Android SDK allows for effortless embedding of the Dailymotion video player in your Android application using a WebView. It supports api level 21+.\nThis SDK that we provide to our publishers is the same tool we use to create our flagship Dailymotion applications. It provides access to the Player API and gives you full control of the player. To learn more please check out official Dailymotion Android developer doc [here](https://developer.dailymotion.com/player/#embed-mobile-android).\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Simple SDK to integrate, provides access to the Player API, no need to specify a layout container for the VideoView\n- The SDK is bundled with a sample application\n- Supports Android 5.0.x (API level 21) and superior\n- Fully in kotlin. If your project is still in JAVA, you will need to add the kotlin dependencies: https://developer.android.com/kotlin/add-kotlin\n\nHow to use\n----------\n\n### Add the SDK to your project\nYou can either import the SDK using your IDE or integrate PlayerWebView.kt in your project.\n\nOur artefacts are hosted on `mavenCentral` <br/>\nUsing gradle, you can import the sdk with :\n```\nimplementation 'com.dailymotion.dailymotion-sdk-android:sdk:0.2.11'\n```\n\nThe sdk will need the following permission and attributes inside your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n```\n\n```\nandroid:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\"\n```\n\n### Use in your Activity or Fragment\nFirst, add the PlayerWebView in your layout in place of the regular WebView.\n\n```xml\n    <com.dailymotion.android.player.sdk.PlayerWebView\n        android:id=\"@+id/dm_player_web_view\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"215dp\" />\n```\n\nThen in your Activity code just launch your content.\nTo play a video, simply call the `load(...)` method of `PlayerWebView`.\n\n\n```kotlin\n    lateinit var playerWebView: PlayerWebView\n    \n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        setContentView(R.layout.screen_sample);\n\n        playerWebView = findViewById(R.id.playerWebview)\n        val params = mapOf(\"video\" to \"x26hv6c\")\n        playerWebView.load(loadParams = params);\n    }\n```\n\nThe `load(...)` method can also take additionnal parameters:\n```kotlin\n    lateinit var playerWebView: PlayerWebView\n    \n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        setContentView(R.layout.screen_sample);\n\n        playerWebView = findViewById(R.id.playerWebview)\n        val params = mapOf(\n                \"video\" to \"videoXId\",\n                \"key2\" to \"value2\",\n                \"key3\" to \"value3\",\n        )\n        playerWebView.load(loadParams = params);\n    }\n```\n\n### Handle screen rotation\nFor the screen rotation to be handled correctly, you need to add\n\n```xml\n    android:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize\"\n```\n\nto any activity using PlayerWebView, in your AndroidManifest.xml\n\n### Lifecycle\nYou have to call onPause and onResume when these events occur in your lifecycle :\n\n```kotlin\n    override fun onPause() {\n        super.onPause()\n        playerWebview.onPause()\n    }\n\n    override fun onResume() {\n        super.onResume()\n        playerWebview.onResume()\n    }\n```\n\n### OM SDK integration\nOpen Measurement SDK from IAB is designed to facilitate third party viewability and verification measurement for ads served to web video and mobile app environments. See https://iabtechlab.com/standards/open-measurement-sdk/ for more details\n\nWe have integrated the SDK in our Dailymotion Player SDK and it does more or less everything out of the box :\n- Ad session management\n- Ad main signals (play, buffer_start, buffer_end, pause, resume, quartiles, click)\n- Device and Player volume management\n- ⚠️ Basic Player state handling. NORMAL or FULLSCREEN based on player fullscreen state.<br/><br/>\nIt's **STRONGLY** recommended to update at all time the player state if your app has more player layout variety, such as mini-player, picture-in-picture, etc...<br/>\nTo do it, simply update the OMHelper `playerState` field : \n```kotlin\n    OMHelper.playerState = PlayerState.COLLAPSED\n```\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6400030/125312203-5ba0c700-e334-11eb-979f-6dd7e5d924ad.png)\n\n### IAB TCF2\nThe SDK follows the [IAB TCF2 standard](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) to [access](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#how-do-third-party-sdks-vendors-access-the-consent-information-in-app) the stored consent string.\nIn order to pass the consent string to the player, just use those lines **after the consent string was generated** by the CMP:\n\n```kotlin\n    // Instantiate the TCF2Handler\n    val tcf2Handler = TCF2Handler()\n    \n    // Make the player load the consent string stored at the location determined by IAB TCF2 Standard\n    val didLoadConsentString = tcf2Handler.loadConsentString(context = this)\n    \n    if (didLoadConsentString) {\n        // Successfully loaded the consent string\n    } else {\n        // Failed to load the consent string: check logs\n    }\n```\n\n### Play Services\nThe SDK uses Google Play Services to get the [Advertising Id](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/ad-id)\nIf your app also uses play services, you may want to override the `play-services-ads-identifier` version to avoid conflicting with other play services artifacts.\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:[your_play_services_version]'\n}\n```\n\nFaq\n---\n\n**Q.** I have an only Java project and I don’t plan to move to Kotlin. How can use your sdk ?\\\n**A.** Starting from 0.2.0, the sdk is Kotlin only however you can still use the previous sdk version which are in Java and still available.\\\nFor instance, [0.1.31](https://bintray.com/dailymotion/com.dailymotion.dailymotion-sdk-android/sdk/0.1.31) is the latest sdk using only Java.\n"

    "text" : "# Google API Client Libraries with Dart\n\nGoogle provides a large set of APIs that your applications can use\nto interact with Google products such as Google Drive, Gmail,\nCloud Datastore, and Cloud Storage.\nThese APIs are accessible via REST-like interfaces.\nThe Dart team provides the googleapis and\ngoogleapis_beta packages,\nwhich provide generated Dart libraries for these APIs.\nUsing the APIs, which are available for\nboth web apps and cloud apps,\nis more convenient and less error-prone\nthan using the raw REST protocol.\n\nTo use any of these APIs, you need a Cloud Project.\nIn addition, based on the API being used, you need either an API\nkey or a Client ID.\nAnd finally, depending on what kind of application is being\nused, you might need a Service Account.\nAll these items are available through\nGoogle Developers Console when you create a project.\nBelow are a few scenarios:\n\n* APIs require a Client ID specific to the kind of application\nwhen it accesses data that is owned by a user\non behalf of that user (with consent):\nfor example a browser application or a console application.\n\n* A server application can access data owned by the application\nitself by using a Service Account.\nExample: a server application accessing data in Datastore\nor Google Cloud Storage.\n\n* APIs that can be used to get public data require only\nan API key (for quota and billing purposes).\n\nTo set up authentication and authorization for your app,\nyou need to create a project, create the authentication credentials,\nand activate the API you want to use, all of which you do at\n<a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com\">Google Developers Console</a>.\n\nSupport for Google APIs is in two packages—<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis\">googleapis</a> and\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta\">googleapis_beta</a>.\nThe googleapis package contains the APIs for all\nthe APIs that are available in a stable version.\nThe googleapis_beta\npackage contains the APIs that are currently in\nbeta and possibly only available through a Limited Preview program.\n\nA third package,\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth\">googleapis_auth</a>,\nprovides a way to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials and an authenticated HTTP client\nrequired to use these APIs.\n\nThe rest of this document describes the following:\n\n* [Some of the APIs you can use](#some-of-the-apis-you-can-use)\n* [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-20)\n* [What do you need?](#what-do-you-need)\n* [A web application example](#a-web-application-example)\n* [Using a service account for a cloud API](#using-a-service-account-for-a-cloud-api)\n* [Contribute](#contribute)\n* [Resource links](#resource-links)\n* [What next?](#what-next)\n\n## Some of the APIs you can use\n\nHere are just a few of the APIs your Dart programs can use.\n\n<dl>\n<dt><img src=\"images/drive.jpeg\" width=\"36\"> Google Drive</dt>\n<dd>\nGoogle Drive is a Cloud Storage service that allows you to store your documents,\nphotos, videos, and more online.\nThe Google Drive client library lets you access Google Drive services,\nsuch as reading and writing files.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><img src=\"images/googlemail.png\" width=\"36\"> Gmail</dt>\n\n<dd>\nThe Gmail API gives you flexible, RESTful access to the user's inbox,\nwith a natural interface to threads, messages, labels, drafts, and history.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><img src=\"images/datastore.png\" width=\"36\"> Cloud Datastore</dt>\n\n<dd>\nUsing Cloud Datastore client libraries you have access\nto a fully managed, schemaless database\nfor storing non-relational data.\nCloud Datastore provides high availability of reads and writes,\nstrong consistency for reads and ancestor queries,\nand eventual consistency for all other queries.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><img src=\"images/cloudstorage.png\" width=\"36\"> Google Cloud Storage</dt>\n<dd>\nGoogle Cloud Storage provides a fast, scalable, highly available object store that scales\nas your needs grow.\nYou can access your data with an HTTP API, a web-based interface,\nor a commmand-line tool.\n</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\nYou can see the full list of APIs at\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis\">googleapis</a> and\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta\">googleapis_beta</a>.\n\n## OAuth 2.0\n\nApplications sometimes require OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.\nWhether an application needs OAuth 2.0\ndepends on the API being used and the kind of data being accessed.\nFor example, an application needs OAuth 2.0 if it needs user consent.\nAn application sometimes needs OAuth 2.0 depending on the\nfollowing properties:\n\n* Using public API (no credentials needed)\n* Using API that can be accessed using an API Key (no concrete user)\n* Using API that provides access to user data (user consent)\n* Using API that provides access to application data (service account)\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 protocol provides different _flows_ for different types\nof applications, including web server, installed, and client-side applications.\nFor example, the following diagram illustrates the flow of communication\nfor client-side applications:\n\n<a name=\"diagram\"></a>\n\n![Token flow in client-only (JavaScript) application](images/client-only-flow.png)\n\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2\">\n  Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs\n</a>\ngives a detailed overview of the OAuth 2.0 authorization\nscenarios that Google supports.\n\n## What do you need?\n\nTo write a program that interacts with a Google product,\nyou need several tools and packages.\n\n<dl>\n\n<dt><strong>A Google account</strong></dt>\n<dd>If you don't already have a Google account, you can create one\nat <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/SignUp\">Create your Google Account</a>.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><strong>A project in Google Developers Console</strong></dt>\n<dd>\nEvery application that uses the client libraries\nneeds a project in Google Developers Console.\nA project is a collection of settings, credentials, and metadata\nabout the application.\nGoogle Developers Console is where you manage aspects of your project,\nsuch as authenticating and authorizing you application, activating APIs,\nand managing team and billing information associated with your project.\nYou must have a project to get OAuth2 service accounts and client IDs.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><strong>The googleapis_auth package</strong></dt>\n<dd>\nAccess to Google APIs uses the HTTP protocol.\nThe googleapis_auth package\nprovides different means for creating an HTTP client that can handle the\nauthorization. This HTTP client is then passed to the API objects and takes care\nof augmenting the communication with the required authorization information.\nThe Dart googleapis_auth client library is available at\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth\">pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth</a>.\nThere you can find a detailed README file with code examples\nand explanatory text.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><strong>The googleapis or googleapis_beta package</strong></dt>\n<dd> These packages are publicly available at\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis\">pub.dev/packages/googleapis</a> and\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta\">pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta</a>.\nLater, you'll see an example of how to use them in your Dart program.\n</dd>\n\n<dt><strong>Dart</strong></dt>\n<dd> Get Dart from <a href=\"https://dart.dev/get-dart\">the download page</a>.\n</dd>\n\n</dl>\n\n## A web application example\n\nLet's look at a web application example that\nuses the googleapis Google Drive API\nto retrieve documents from a user's Google Drive.\nThe following screenshot shows the app\nafter it has retrieved a list of spreadsheets\nfrom a user's Google Drive and displayed them on the page.\n\n![A list of spreadsheets retrieved from Google Drive using client library APIs](images/spreadsheets-list.png)\n\nYou can find the source code for this example,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_examples/tree/master/drive_search_web\">drive_search_web</a>,\nand others, at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_examples\">googleapis_examples</a>\non GitHub.\n\nThe section [Example explained](#example-explained)\ndescribes the code in the drive_search_web example related to googleapis\nand googleapis_auth.\nBut first let's look at how to run the example.\n\n### Running the example\n\nTo run this example, you need to create a project, activate an API,\nand create a Client ID in Google Developers Console.\nThis section provides instructions about how to do these for this\nparticular example.\nFor complete information and detailed explanations, refer to\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/\">Google Developers Console Help</a>.\n\n#### Create project\n\n* Go to <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/\">Google Developers Console</a>.\n\n* Click the <strong>Create Project</strong> button.\n\n* Provide a name for your project.\n\n* Click the <strong>Create</strong> button.\n\n#### Activate the Drive API\n\n* On left of the project page, click <strong>APIs & auth</strong>,\nclick <strong>APIs</strong>.\n\n* Turn on the authentication for <strong>Drive API</strong>.\nIt might take a couple of minutes to propagate.\n\n#### Create a client ID\n\n* On the left of the project page, under <strong>APIs &amp; Auth</strong>,\nthen click <strong>Credentials</strong>.\n\n* Click <strong>Create new Client ID</strong>.\n\n* In the popup window,\nclick <strong>Web application</strong>, then fill in the form.\nUse http://localhost:8080 for\n<strong>Authorized JavaScript origins</strong>.\nBecause this example is a client-side-only application,\ndon't put a value in <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong>.\nThis example runs on the local computer and uses port 8080.\nEnsure nothing else is using port 8080.\nIf you later run this example from a different origin,\nyou'll need a new Client ID.\n\n* Click <strong>Create Client ID</strong>.\n\n#### Run the example\n\n* In the index.dart file,\nchange <strong><please fill in></strong> to the client ID generated\nin the previous step.\nThe client ID ends in apps.googeusercontent.com.\n\n* In the top directory of the application, run `pub serve`.\n\n* Visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser window.\n  After a little while, you'll see a built version of the app.\n\n* Click <strong>Authorize</strong>\nand accept the authorization on the page that appears.\n\n* Select a document type from the drop-down menu and click <strong>List</strong>.\nThe program displays the list of files from the Google Drive of the user who is currently\nlogged in. (Later the user can revoke access if desired.) Refer to\n<a href=\"http://security.google.com\">Security - Account Settings</a> for details.\n\nThis example, drive_search_web,\nuses the Google Drive API and the OAuth 2.0 API to\naccess the user's files on Google Drive.\nLet's look at the relevant parts of the example.\n\n\n* To use the googleapi packages,\n  you need to declare dependencies\n  in the pubspec.yaml file.\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  googleapis_auth: '>=0.1.0 < 0.2.0'\n  googleapis: '>=0.1.1 < 0.2.0'\n```\n\n\n* In addition to declaring dependencies, you need to import\n  the libraries from the packages into your Dart file.\n  This example has only one Dart file, index.dart,\n  which imports the libraries like this:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:googleapis_auth/auth_browser.dart' as auth;\nimport 'package:googleapis/drive/v2.dart' as drive;\n```\n\n* At the top level, the program gets an identifier for the client\n  with its ID created in Google Developers Console.\n  In addition, the code defines the scope of the APIs it intends to use.\n  The scope controls the set of APIs or parts of APIs that can access\n  token permits. During the access-token request,\n  your application sends one or more values in the scope parameter.\n\n```dart\nfinal identifier = new auth.ClientId(\n     \"<custom-app-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n     null);\n\nfinal scopes = [drive.DriveApi.DriveScope];\n```\n\n* The main() method authorizes\n  the client with a call to authorizedClient(),\n  passing the identifier and scopes in as parameters.\n\n```dart\nauthorizedClient(loginButton, identifier, scopes).then((client) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nLet's take a look at authorizedClient().\n\n```dart\nFuture authorizedClient(ButtonElement loginButton, auth.ClientId id, scopes) {\n  return auth.createImplicitBrowserFlow(id, scopes)\n      .then((auth.BrowserOAuth2Flow flow) {\n        return flow.clientViaUserConsent(forceUserConsent: false).catchError((_) {\n          loginButton.text = '';\n          return loginButton.onClick.first.then((_) {\n            return flow.clientViaUserConsent(forceUserConsent: true);\n          });\n        }, test: (error) => error is auth.UserConsentException);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nFirst the code initializes the browser flow as illustrated in the\nOAuth 2.0 diagram <a href=\"#diagram\">above</a>.\nThen the program attempts to proceed without user consent\nusing flow.clientViaUserConsent() with <code>false</code>\nas a parameter value.\nIf the user previously gave consent, this will succeed.\nOtherwise, the program sets up the authorization button in the UI.\nWhen the user presses the button,\nthe program brings up a popup window where the user can provide consent.\nTo ask the user for consent, the code call flow.clientViaUserConsent()\nagain using <code>true</code> for the parameter value.\n\n* In the main() function,\n  the code gets access to the Drive API by creating a new DriveApi object\n  and passing in the HTTP client.\n\n```dart\nvar api = new drive.DriveApi(client);\n```\n\n* The code uses the API provided by the DriveApi object to\n  search the user's documents:\n\n```dart\nFuture<List<drive.File>> searchTextDocuments(drive.DriveApi api,\n                                             int max,\n                                             String query) {\n  var docs = [];\n  Future next(String token) {\n    // The API call returns only a subset of the results. It is possible\n    // to query through the whole result set via \"paging\".\n    return api.files.list(q: query, pageToken: token, maxResults: max)\n        .then((results) {\n      docs.addAll(results.items);\n      // If we would like to have more documents, we iterate.\n      if (docs.length < max && results.nextPageToken != null) {\n        return next(results.nextPageToken);\n      }\n      return docs;\n    });\n  }\n  return next(null);\n}\n```\n\n## Using a service account for a Cloud API\n\nFor APIs such as Cloud Datastore and Cloud Storage\nyou need a Google service account,\nwhich is an account that represents your application\ninstead of an individual end user.\nYou can create one when creating a new Client ID:\njust click <strong>Service account</strong>\ninstead of <strong>Web application</strong>.\n\nThe example\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_examples/tree/master/cloudstorage_upload_download_service_account\">cloudstorage_upload_download_service_account</a>\nneeds a service account because it uses the Google Cloud Storage API.\n\nLet's take a quick look at the relevant code.\n\nThe following code creates account credentials from the service account\nspecified in the details of the given JSON string.\nAfter you create the service account,\nyou can download the JSON from the Cloud Console.\nThen enter the appropriate information to replace the\n<strong><please fill in></strong> placeholders.\n\n```dart\nfinal accountCredentials = new auth.ServiceAccountCredentials.fromJson(r'''\n{\n  \"private_key_id\": \"<please fill in>\",\n  \"private_key\": \"<please fill in>\",\n  \"client_email\": \"<please fill in>@developer.gserviceaccount.com\",\n  \"client_id\": \"<please fill in>.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n  \"type\": \"service_account\"\n}\n''');\n```\n\nThe program selects the scopes it will use\nand gets the StorageAPI, just like the previous example retrieved the Drive API.\n\n```dart\nfinal scopes = [storage.StorageApi.DevstorageFullControlScope];\n...\nvar api = new storage.StorageApi(client);\n```\n\nUsing the credentials and scopes parameters,\na call to clientViaServiceAccount\ngets an authenticated client that can use the Storage APIs.\n\n```dart\nauth.clientViaServiceAccount(accountCredentials, scopes).then((client) {\n  ...\n  var regexp = new RegExp(r'^gs://([^/]+)/(.+)$');\n  switch (args.first) {\n    case 'upload':\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nNote that the code shown above creates accountCredentials,\nwhich identifies this application.\nThe code specified by then() processes the command-line arguments and uploads\nor downloads a file as indicated.\n\nThe following line of code uses the Storage API to upload a\nmedia file to Google Cloud Storage.\n\n```dart\nreturn api.objects.insert(null, bucket, name: object, uploadMedia: media);\n```\n\n## Resource links\n\nHere's a convenient list of the resources you might need:\n\n* <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com\">Google Developers Console</a>\n* <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/\">Google Developers Console Help</a>\n* <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2\">Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google Apis</a>\n* <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis\">googleapis</a>\n* <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth\">googleapis_auth</a>\n* <a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta\">googleapis_beta</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_examples\">googleapis_examples</a>\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe following notes for those who are contributing to this package.\nIf you are only using this package, you can skip this section.\n\nIf you are only making changes to `googleapis_auth`, then you only need to run\ntests for that package and can skip the remainder of this section. Specifically,\nbefore submitting a pull request:\n\n  ```console\n  $ pushd googleapis_auth\n  $ pub get\n  $ pub run test\n  $ dart format . --fix\n  $ popd\n  ```\nOtherwise...\n\n* Clone this package and run `pub upgrade` from the `generator` directory.\n\n  ```console\n  $ cd generator\n  $ rm -rf .dart_tool\n  $ pub upgrade\n  ```\n\n* Download and generate the APIs using the `config.yaml` configuration\n  (avoid doing this on corp network, use cloudshell instead).\n\n  ```console\n  $ dart generator/bin/generate.dart run_config download\n  ```\n\n**Note:**\nYou may need to reset some of the downloaded discovery documents,\nsuch as [drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/),\nor [prediction](https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/developer-guide).\n\n* Generate the APIs.\n\n  ```console\n  $ dart generator/bin/generate.dart run_config generate\n  ```\n\n* Create a diff with the previous APIs to determine whether a minor or a major\n  update to the version number is required.\n\n* Update the appropriate `CHANGELOG.md` file under `resources/`.\n\n* Update `config.yaml` with a new version number and generate again.\n\n  ```console\n  $ dart bin/generate.dart run_config generate\n  ```\n\n* Run the tests.\n\n  ```console\n  $ pushd generated/googleapis\n  $ pub get\n  $ pub run test\n  $ cd ../googleapis_beta\n  $ pub get\n  $ pub run test\n  $ popd\n  ```\n\n* Commit the downloaded discovery documents and generated packages.\n\n## What next?\n\n* Read the README and the code for the packages on pub.dev:\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth\">googleapis_auth</a>.\n\n* Check out additional APIs that are currently in beta and possibly\nonly available through a Limited Preview program:\n<a href=\"https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_beta\">googleapis_beta</a>.\n\n* Play with some <a href=\"https://github.com/dart-lang/googleapis_examples\">examples</a>.\n\n* Read the reference documentation.\n  These APIs are common to many languages including Python, Java, and others.\n  You can refer to the general reference documentation at the\n  <a href=\"http://developers.google.com/products/\">developers' products page</a>.\n  Find the product you're interested in on that page and follow the link.\n  Be sure to look the API reference docs for Dart as some of the Dart APIs have quirks.\n"

See the GNU\nLesser General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\n## Features\n* Support iOS and Android\n* Integrates with Unity's Social API\n* Works with the official Facebook SDK\n* Google Cloud Save\n* Leaderboards\n* Achievements\n* Signin\n\n\n## Usage for iOS\n\n* Read the iOS SDK docs to understand how all fits in. https://developers.google.com/games/services/ios/quickstart\n* On first usage, run bootstrap.sh to download the necessary SDKs. If newer SDKs are available than the one in bootstrap then download those and rename paths in Assets/Editor/googleplay_xcode.py.\n* Setup GooglePlayAppID and bundleId of your app/game in googleplay_xcode.\n* To test the sample App, in GCGui.cs file setup clientId from googleplay and rest of leaderboardip.\n* Run and build app on ipad. click on Init GPG before doing anything else. Try silentSignin and if it fails it will display SignIn button. Use that to do proper auto with switching.\n\n## Trouble Shooting\n\n### Signin doesn't work\n\nThe plugin expects google chrome in application:openUrl part. Change code there to allow any type of browser. \nMake sure bundled, gpgappid etc are all setup properly in both project and google dev console web guy.\n\n### Xcode Project Corrupted\n\nThere is PostBuildProcess script that adds frameworks and configures the overall project. Try removing that and add frameworks/bundles yourself using googleplay docs\nUse the quickstart guide link https://developers.google.com/games/services/ios/quickstart for more information\n\n### Conflicts with other plugins\n* If there is another PostBuildProcess from another plugin (facebook etc) then chain script from this one so that it runs as well.\n* The postbuildprocess patches AppController.m file by adding handler for google signin\n\n```objc\n(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n             openURL:(NSURL *)url\n   sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication\n          annotation:(id)annotation \n```\n\nThis might conflict with facebook and you would need to remove the patch from PostBuildProcess and add this code manually each time project is generated. You coud also make a combined patch for google and other plugins.\n\n## Usage for Android\n\nImport the package\n\nOpen NerdGPG.cs and specify the appID of your game (you get this online on the google play games console).\n\nIn the editor, you should see a menu at the top called \"Nerdiacs\". Press Nerdiacs->UpdateGPGFiles.\n\nIf console doesnt report any errors, it means your game is perfectly setup . enjoy :).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n* Recheck  you followed the instructions correctly\n\n* Check if AndroidManifest.xml has following entries inside application tag \n```xml\n<meta-data ns0:name=\"com.google.android.gms.games.APP_ID\" ns0:value=\"@string/app_id\" />\n<meta-data ns0:name=\"com.google.android.gms.appstate.APP_ID\" ns0:value=\"@string/app_id\" />\n<activity ns0:label=\"@string/app_name\" ns0:name=\"com.nerdiacs.nerdgpgplugin.DummyActivity\" /> \n```\n\n* Check if plugins/android/res/nerdiacs.xml has correct googleplay appid with following tag in resources\n```xml\n<string name=\"app_id\">YOURAPP_ID</string>\n```\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Conflict resolution for both iOS and Android is very basic. It automatically selects localData as resolvedData and overrides whatever is received from cloud. Best way is to always load data at start of app before trying to store. This would sync the data properly.\n* 512k of mem is always allocated for clouddata in Mono (iOS) and Java (Android). It will be changed once I figure out a better way to pass around byte arrays in java.\n \n## TODO\n\n* Add support for multiplayer matchmaking\n* Add support for sharing on google+\n"

Some distributions of IDEs include the SDK when installed, and may place it under the same directory as the IDE. This can be bad when you need to upgrade (or reinstall) the IDE, as you may lose your SDK installation, forcing a long and tedious redownload.\n\nAlso avoid putting the SDK in a system-level directory that might need root permissions, to avoid permissions issues.\n\n### Build system\n\nYour default option should be [Gradle](https://gradle.org) using the [Android Gradle plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html). \n\nIt is important that your application's build process is defined by your Gradle files, rather than being reliant on IDE specific configurations. This allows for consistent builds between tools and better support for continuous integration systems.\n\n### Project structure\n\nAlthough Gradle offers a large degree of flexibility in your project structure, unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise, you should accept its [default structure](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html#sourcesets) as this simplify your build scripts. \n\n### Gradle configuration\n\n**General structure.** Follow [Google's guide on Gradle for Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html).\n\n**minSdkVersion: 21** We recommend to have a look at the [Android version usage chart](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform) before defining the minimum API required. Remember that the statistics given are global statistics and may differ when targeting a specific regional/demographic market. It is worth mentioning that some material design features are only available on Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above. And also, from API 21, the multidex support library is not needed anymore.\n\n**Small tasks.** Instead of (shell, Python, Perl, etc) scripts, you can make tasks in Gradle. Just follow [Gradle's documentation](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#N10CBF) for more details. Google also provides some helpful [Gradle recipes](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-tips.html), specific to Android.\n\n**Passwords.** In your app's `build.gradle` you will need to define the `signingConfigs` for the release build. Here is what you should avoid:\n\n_Don't do this_. This would appear in the version control system.\n\n```groovy\nsigningConfigs {\n    release {\n        // DON'T DO THIS!!\n        storeFile file(\"myapp.keystore\")\n        storePassword \"password123\"\n        keyAlias \"thekey\"\n        keyPassword \"password789\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nInstead, make a `gradle.properties` file which should _not_ be added to the version control system:\n\n```\nKEYSTORE_PASSWORD=password123\nKEY_PASSWORD=password789\n```\n\nThat file is automatically imported by Gradle, so you can use it in `build.gradle` as such:\n\n```groovy\nsigningConfigs {\n    release {\n        try {\n            storeFile file(\"myapp.keystore\")\n            storePassword KEYSTORE_PASSWORD\n            keyAlias \"thekey\"\n            keyPassword KEY_PASSWORD\n        }\n        catch (ex) {\n            throw new InvalidUserDataException(\"You should define KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and KEY_PASSWORD in gradle.properties.\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Prefer Maven dependency resolution to importing jar files.** If you explicitly include jar files in your project, they will be a specific frozen version, such as `2.1.1`. Downloading jars and handling updates is cumbersome and is a problem that Maven already solves properly. Where possible, you should attempt to use Maven to resolve your dependencies, for example:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp3:3.8.0'\n}\n```    \n\n**Avoid Maven dynamic dependency resolution**\nAvoid the use of dynamic dependency versions, such as `2.1.+` as this may result in different and unstable builds or subtle, untracked differences in behavior between builds. The use of static versions such as `2.1.1` helps create a more stable, predictable and repeatable development environment.\n\n**Use different package name for non-release builds**\nUse `applicationIdSuffix` for *debug* [build type](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Build-Types) to be able to install both *debug* and *release* apk on the same device (do this also for custom build types, if you need any). This will be especially valuable after your app has been published.\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    buildTypes {\n        debug {\n            applicationIdSuffix '.debug'\n            versionNameSuffix '-DEBUG'\n        }\n\n        release {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUse different icons to distinguish the builds installed on a device—for example with different colors or an overlaid  \"debug\" label. Gradle makes this very easy: with default project structure, simply put *debug* icon in `app/src/debug/res` and *release* icon in `app/src/release/res`. You could also [change app name](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24785270/how-to-change-app-name-per-gradle-build-type) per build type, as well as  `versionName` (as in the above example).\n\n**Share debug app keystore file**\nSharing the debug APK keystore file via the app repository saves time when testing on shared devices and avoids the uninstalling/reinstalling of the app. It also simplifies the processing of working with some Android SDKs, such as Facebook, which require the registration of a single key store hash. Unlike the release key file, the debug key file can safely be added to your repository.\n\n**Share code style formatting defintions**\nSharing the code style and formatting definitions via the app repository helps ensure a visually consistent code base and makes code comprehension and reviews easier.\n\n### Android Studio as your main IDE\n\nThe recommended IDE for Android development is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) because it is developed and constantly updated by Google, has good support for Gradle, contains a range of useful monitoring and analysis tools and is fully tailored for Android development.\n\nAvoid adding Android Studio's specific configuration files, such as `.iml` files to the version control system as these often contain configurations specific of your local machine, which won't work for your colleagues.\n\n### Libraries\n\n**[Jackson](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome)** is a Java library for JSON serialization and deserialization, it has a wide-scoped and versatile API, supporting various ways of processing JSON: streaming, in-memory tree model, and traditional JSON-POJO data binding. \n\n[Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) is another popular choice and being a smaller library than Jackson, you might prefer it to avoid 65k methods limitation. Also, if you are using  \n\n[Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi), another of [Square's](https://github.com/square) open source libraries, builds upon learnings from the development of Gson and also integrates well with Kotlin.\n\n<a name=\"networklibs\"></a>\n**Networking, caching, and images.** There are a couple of battle-proven solutions for performing requests to backend servers, which you should use rather than implementing your own client. We recommend basing your stack around [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) for efficient HTTP requests and using [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to provide a typesafe layer. If you choose Retrofit, consider [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) for loading and caching images.\n\nRetrofit, Picasso and OkHttp are created by the same company, so they complement each other nicely and compatability issues are uncommon.\n\n[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) is another option for loading and caching images. It has support for animated GIFs, circular images and claims of better performance than Picasso, but also a bigger method count.\n\n**RxJava** is a library for Reactive Programming, in other words, handling asynchronous events. It is a powerful paradigm, but it also has a steep learning curve. We recommend taking some caution before using this library to architect the entire application. We have written some blog posts on it: [[1]](http://blog.futurice.com/tech-pick-of-the-week-rx-for-net-and-rxjava-for-android), [[2]](http://blog.futurice.com/top-7-tips-for-rxjava-on-android), [[3]](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754), [[4]](http://blog.futurice.com/android-development-has-its-own-swift). For a reference app, our open source app [Freesound Android](https://github.com/futurice/freesound-android) makes extensive use of RxJava 2.\n\nIf you have no previous experience with Rx, start by applying it only for responses from app's backend APIs. Alternatively, start by applying it for simple UI event handling, like click events or typing events on a search field. If you are confident in your Rx skills and want to apply it to the whole architecture, then write documentation on all the tricky parts. Keep in mind that another programmer unfamiliar to RxJava might have a very hard time maintaining the project. Do your best to help them understand your code and also Rx.\n\nUse [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) for Android threading support and [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding) to easily create Observables from existing Android components.\n\n**[Retrolambda](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda)** is a Java library for using Lambda expression syntax in Android and other pre-JDK8 platforms. It helps keep your code tight and readable especially if you use a functional style, such as in RxJava.\n\nAndroid Studio offers code assist support for Java 8 lambdas. If you are new to lambdas, just use the following to get started:\n\n- Any interface with just one method is \"lambda friendly\" and can be folded into the more tight syntax\n- If in doubt about parameters and such, write a normal anonymous inner class and then let Android Studio fold it into a lambda for you.\n\nNote that from Android Studio 3.0, [Retrolambda is no longer required](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features/java8-support.html).\n\n<a name=\"methodlimitation\"></a>\n**Beware of the dex method limitation, and avoid using many libraries.** Android apps, when packaged as a dex file, have a hard limitation of 65536 referenced methods [[1]](https://medium.com/@rotxed/dex-skys-the-limit-no-65k-methods-is-28e6cb40cf71) [[2]](http://blog.persistent.info/2014/05/per-package-method-counts-for-androids.html) [[3]](http://jakewharton.com/play-services-is-a-monolith/). You will see a fatal error on compilation if you pass the limit. For that reason, use a minimal amount of libraries, and use the [dex-method-counts](https://github.com/mihaip/dex-method-counts) tool to determine which set of libraries can be used in order to stay under the limit. Especially avoid using the Guava library, since it contains over 13k methods.\n\n### Activities and Fragments\n\nThere is no consensus among the community nor Futurice developers how to best organize Android architectures with Fragments and Activities. Square even has [a library for building architectures mostly with Views](https://github.com/square/mortar), bypassing the need for Fragments, but this still is not considered a widely recommendable practice in the community.\n\nBecause of Android API's history, you can loosely consider Fragments as UI pieces of a screen. In other words, Fragments are normally related to UI. Activities can be loosely considered to be controllers, they are especially important for their lifecycle and for managing state. However, you are likely to see variation in these roles: activities might take UI roles ([delivering transitions between screens](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop.html)), and [fragments might be used solely as controllers](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#AddingWithoutUI). We suggest you sail carefully, making informed decisions since there are drawbacks for choosing a fragments-only architecture, or activities-only, or views-only. Here is some advice on what to be careful with, but take them with a grain of salt:\n\n- Avoid using [nested fragments](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.2.html#NestedFragments) extensively, because [matryoshka bugs](http://delyan.me/android-s-matryoshka-problem/) can occur. Use nested fragments only when it makes sense (for instance, fragments in a horizontally-sliding ViewPager inside a screen-like fragment) or if it's a well-informed decision.\n- Avoid putting too much code in Activities. Whenever possible, keep them as lightweight containers, existing in your application primarily for the lifecycle and other important Android-interfacing APIs. Prefer single-fragment activities instead of plain activities - put UI code into the activity's fragment. This makes it reusable in case you need to change it to reside in a tabbed layout, or in a multi-fragment tablet screen. Avoid having an activity without a corresponding fragment, unless you are making an informed decision.\n\n### Java packages structure\n\nWe recommend using a *feature based* package structure for your code. This has the following benefits:\n\n- Clearer feature dependency and interface boundaries.\n- Promotes encapsulation.\n- Easier to understand the components that define the feature.  \n- Reduces risk of unknowingly modifying unrelated or shared code.\n- Simpler navigation: most related classes will be in the one package.\n- Easier to remove a feature.\n- Simplifies the transition to module based build structure (better build times and Instant Apps support)\n\nThe alternative approach of defining your packages by *how* a feature is built (by placing related Activities, Fragments, Adapters etc in separate packages) can lead to a fragmented code base with less implementation flexibility. Most importantly, it hinders your ability to comprehend your code base in terms of its primary role: to provide features for your app.   \n\n### Resources\n\n**Naming.** Follow the convention of prefixing the type, as in `type_foo_bar.xml`. Examples: `fragment_contact_details.xml`, `view_primary_button.xml`, `activity_main.xml`.\n\n**Organizing layout XMLs.** If you're unsure how to format a layout XML, the following convention may help.\n\n- One attribute per line, indented by 4 spaces\n- `android:id` as the first attribute always\n- `android:layout_****` attributes at the top\n- `style` attribute at the bottom\n- Tag closer `/>` on its own line, to facilitate ordering and adding attributes.\n- Rather than hard coding `android:text`, consider using [Designtime attributes](http://tools.android.com/tips/layout-designtime-attributes) available for Android Studio.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<LinearLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n    >\n\n    <TextView\n        android:id=\"@+id/name\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_alignParentRight=\"true\"\n        android:text=\"@string/name\"\n        style=\"@style/FancyText\"\n        />\n\n    <include layout=\"@layout/reusable_part\" />\n\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\nAs a rule of thumb, attributes `android:layout_****` should be defined in the layout XML, while other attributes `android:****` should stay in a style XML. This rule has exceptions, but in general works fine. The idea is to keep only layout (positioning, margin, sizing) and content attributes in the layout files, while keeping all appearance details (colors, padding, font) in styles files.\n\nThe exceptions are:\n\n- `android:id` should obviously be in the layout files\n- `android:orientation` for a `LinearLayout` normally makes more sense in layout files\n- `android:text` should be in layout files because it defines content\n- Sometimes it will make sense to make a generic style defining `android:layout_width` and `android:layout_height` but by default these should appear in the layout files\n\n<a name=\"styles\"></a>\n**Use styles.** Almost every project needs to properly use styles, because it is very common to have a repeated appearance for a view. At least you should have a common style for most text content in the application, for example:\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"ContentText\">\n    <item name=\"android:textSize\">@dimen/font_normal</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">@color/basic_black</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nApplied to TextViews:\n\n```xml\n<TextView\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:text=\"@string/price\"\n    style=\"@style/ContentText\"\n    />\n```\n\nYou probably will need to do the same for buttons, but don't stop there yet. Go beyond and move a group of related and repeated `android:****` attributes to a common style.\n\n<a name=\"splitstyles\"></a>\n**Split a large style file into other files.** You don't need to have a single `styles.xml` file. Android SDK supports other files out of the box, there is nothing magical about the name `styles`, what matters are the XML tags `<style>` inside the file. Hence you can have files `styles.xml`, `styles_home.xml`, `styles_item_details.xml`, `styles_forms.xml`. Unlike resource directory names which carry some meaning for the build system, filenames in `res/values` can be arbitrary.\n\n<a name=\"colorsxml\"></a>\n**`colors.xml` is a color palette.** There should be nothing in your `colors.xml` other than a mapping from a color name to an RGBA value. This helps avoid repeating RGBA values and as such will make it easy to change or refactor colors, and also will make it explicit how many different colors are being used. Normally for a aesthetic UI, it is important to reduce the variety of colors being used.\n \n*So, don't define your colors.xml like this:*\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n    <color name=\"button_foreground\">#FFFFFF</color>\n    <color name=\"button_background\">#2A91BD</color>\n</resources>    \n```\n\nInstead, do this:\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n    <!-- grayscale -->\n    <color name=\"white\">#FFFFFF</color>\n   \n    <!-- basic colors -->\n    <color name=\"blue\">#2A91BD</color>\n</resources>\n```\n\nAsk the designer of the application for this palette. The names do not need to be plain color names as \"green\", \"blue\", etc. Names such as \"brand_primary\", \"brand_secondary\", \"brand_negative\" are totally acceptable as well.\n\nBy referencing the color palette from your styles allows you to abstract the underlying colors from their usage in the app, as per:\n\n- `colors.xml` - defines only the color palette.\n- `styles.xml` - defines styles which reference the color palette and reflects the color usage. (e.g. the button foreground is white).\n- `activity_main.xml` - references the appropriate style in `styles.xml` to color the button.\n\nIf needed, even further separation between underlying colors and style usage can be achieved by defined an additional color resource file which references the color palette. As per:\n\n```xml\n<color name=\"button_foreground\">@color/white</color> \n<color name=\"button_background\">@color/blue</color> \n```\n\nThen in styles.xml:\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"AcceptButton\">\n    <item name=\"android:foreground\">@color/button_foreground</item>\n    <item name=\"android:background\">@color/button_background</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nThis approach offers improved color refactoring and more stable style definitions when multiple related styles share similar color and usage properties. However, it comes at the cost of maintaining another set of color mappings. \n\n<a name=\"dimensxml\"></a>\n**Treat dimens.xml like colors.xml.** You should also define a \"palette\" of typical spacing and font sizes, for basically the same purposes as for colors. A good example of a dimens file:\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n\n    <!-- font sizes -->\n    <dimen name=\"font_larger\">22sp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"font_large\">18sp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"font_normal\">15sp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"font_small\">12sp</dimen>\n\n    <!-- typical spacing between two views -->\n    <dimen name=\"spacing_huge\">40dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"spacing_large\">24dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"spacing_normal\">14dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"spacing_small\">10dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"spacing_tiny\">4dp</dimen>\n\n    <!-- typical sizes of views -->\n    <dimen name=\"button_height_tall\">60dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"button_height_normal\">40dp</dimen>\n    <dimen name=\"button_height_short\">32dp</dimen>\n\n</resources>\n```\n\nYou should use the `spacing_****` dimensions for layouting, in margins and paddings, instead of hard-coded values, much like strings are normally treated. This will give a consistent look-and-feel, while making it easier to organize and change styles and layouts.\n\n**strings.xml**\n\nName your strings with keys that resemble namespaces, and don't be afraid of repeating a value for two or more keys. Languages are complex, so namespaces are necessary to bring context and break ambiguity.\n\n**Bad**\n```xml\n<string name=\"network_error\">Network error</string>\n<string name=\"call_failed\">Call failed</string>\n<string name=\"map_failed\">Map loading failed</string>\n```\n\n**Good**\n```xml\n<string name=\"error_message_network\">Network error</string>\n<string name=\"error_message_call\">Call failed</string>\n<string name=\"error_message_map\">Map loading failed</string>\n```\n\nDon't write string values in all uppercase. Stick to normal text conventions (e.g., capitalize first character). If you need to display the string in all caps, then do that using for instance the attribute [`textAllCaps`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:textAllCaps) on a TextView.\n\n**Bad**\n```xml\n<string name=\"error_message_call\">CALL FAILED</string>\n```\n\n**Good**\n```xml\n<string name=\"error_message_call\">Call failed</string>\n```\n\n<a name=\"deephierarchy\"></a>\n**Avoid a deep hierarchy of views.** Sometimes you might be tempted to just add yet another LinearLayout, to be able to accomplish an arrangement of views. This kind of situation may occur:\n\n```xml\n<LinearLayout\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n    >\n\n    <RelativeLayout\n        ...\n        >\n\n        <LinearLayout\n            ...\n            >\n\n            <LinearLayout\n                ...\n                >\n\n                <LinearLayout\n                    ...\n                    >\n                </LinearLayout>\n\n            </LinearLayout>\n\n        </LinearLayout>\n\n    </RelativeLayout>\n\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\nEven if you don't witness this explicitly in a layout file, it might end up happening if you are inflating (in Java) views into other views.\n\nA couple of problems may occur. You might experience performance problems, because there is a complex UI tree that the processor needs to handle. Another more serious issue is a possibility of [StackOverflowError](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2762924/java-lang-stackoverflow-error-suspected-too-many-views).\n\nTherefore, try to keep your views hierarchy as flat as possible: learn how to use [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/index.html), how to [optimize your layouts](http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/optimizing-layout.html) and to use the [`<merge>` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8834898/what-is-the-purpose-of-androids-merge-tag-in-xml-layouts).\n\n<a name=\"webviews\"></a>\n**Beware of problems related to WebViews.** When you must display a web page, for instance for a news article, avoid doing client-side processing to clean the HTML, rather ask for a \"*pure*\" HTML from the backend programmers. [WebViews can also leak memory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3130654/memory-leak-in-webview) when they keep a reference to their Activity, instead of being bound to the ApplicationContext. Avoid using a WebView for simple texts or buttons, prefer the platform's widgets.\n\n\n### Test Frameworks\n\n**Use [JUnit](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html) for unit testing** Plain, Android dependency-free unit testing on the JVM is best done using [Junit](https://junit.org). \n\n**Avoid [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/)** Prior to the improved support for JUnit in the Android build system, Robolectric was promoted as a test framework seeking to provide tests \"disconnected from device\" for the sake of development speed. However, testing under Robolectric is inaccurate and incomplete as it works by providing mock implementations of the Android platform, which provides no guarantees of correctness. Instead, use a combination of JVM based unit tests and dedicated on-device integration tests.\n\n**[Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html) makes writing UI tests easy.**\n\n**[AssertJ-Android](http://square.github.io/assertj-android/) an AssertJ extension library making assertions easy in Android tests**  Assert-J comes modules easier for you to test Android specific components, such as the Android Support, Google Play Services and Appcompat libraries.\n\nA test assertion will look like:\n\n```java\n// Example assertion using AssertJ-Android\nassertThat(layout).isVisible()\n    .isVertical()\n    .hasChildCount(5);\n```\n\n### Emulators\n\nThe performance of the Android SDK emulator, particularly the x86 variant, has improvement markedly in recent years and is now adequate for most day-to-day development scenarios. However, you should not discount the value of ensuring your application behaves correctly on real devices. Of course, testing on all possible devices is not practical, so rather focus your efforts on devices with a large market share and those most relevant to your app.\n\n### Proguard configuration\n\n[ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) is normally used on Android projects to shrink and obfuscate the packaged code.\n\nWhether you are using ProGuard or not depends on your project configuration. Usually you would configure Gradle to use ProGuard when building a release APK.\n\n```groovy\nbuildTypes {\n    debug {\n        minifyEnabled false\n    }\n    release {\n        signingConfig signingConfigs.release\n        minifyEnabled true\n        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn order to determine which code has to be preserved and which code can be discarded or obfuscated, you have to specify one or more entry points to your code. These entry points are typically classes with main methods, applets, midlets, activities, etc.\nAndroid framework uses a default configuration which can be found from `SDK_HOME/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt`. Using the above configuration, custom project-specific ProGuard rules, as defined in `my-project/app/proguard-rules.pro`, will be appended to the default configuration.\n\nA common problem related to ProGuard is to see the application crashing on startup with `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoSuchFieldException` or similar, even though the build command (i.e. `assembleRelease`) succeeded without warnings.\nThis means one out of two things:\n\n1. ProGuard has removed the class, enum, method, field or annotation, considering it's not required.\n2. ProGuard has obfuscated (renamed) the class, enum or field name, but it's being used indirectly by its original name, i.e. through Java reflection.\n\nCheck `app/build/outputs/proguard/release/usage.txt` to see if the object in question has been removed.\nCheck `app/build/outputs/proguard/release/mapping.txt` to see if the object in question has been obfuscated.\n\nIn order to prevent ProGuard from *stripping away* needed classes or class members, add a `keep` options to your ProGuard config:\n```\n-keep class com.futurice.project.MyClass { *; }\n```\n\nTo prevent ProGuard from *obfuscating* classes or class members, add a `keepnames`:\n```\n-keepnames class com.futurice.project.MyClass { *; }\n```\n\nRead more at [Proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard/manual/examples) for examples.\n\n**Early in your project, make and test release build** to check whether ProGuard rules are correctly retaining your dependencies. Also whenever you include new libraries or update their dependencies, make a release build and test the APK on a device. Don't wait until your app is finally version \"1.0\" to make a release build, you might get several unpleasant surprises and a short time to fix them.\n\n**Tip.** Save the `mapping.txt` file for every release that you publish to your users. By retaining a copy of the `mapping.txt` file for each release build, you ensure that you can debug a problem if a user encounters a bug and submits an obfuscated stack trace.\n\n**DexGuard**. If you need hard-core tools for optimizing, and specially obfuscating release code, consider [DexGuard](http://www.saikoa.com/dexguard), a commercial software made by the same team that built ProGuard. It can also easily split Dex files to solve the 65k methods limitation.\n\n### Data storage\n\n\n#### SharedPreferences\n\nIf you only need to persist simple values and your application runs in a single process SharedPreferences is probably enough for you. It is a good default option. \n\nThere are some situations where SharedPreferences are not suitable:\n\n* *Performance*: Your data is complex or there is a lot of it\n* *Multiple processes accessing the data*: You have widgets or remote services that run in their own processes and require synchronized data\n* *Relational data* Distinct parts of your data are relational and you want to enforce that those relationships are maintained.\n\nYou can also store more complex objects by serializing them to JSON to store them and deserializing them when retrieving. You should consider the tradeoffs when doing this as it may not be particularly performant, nor maintainable.\n\n#### ContentProviders\n\nIn case SharedPreferences are not enough, you should use the platform standard ContentProviders, which are fast and process safe.\n\nThe single problem with ContentProviders is the amount of boilerplate code that is needed to set them up, as well as low quality tutorials. It is possible, however, to generate the ContentProvider by using a library such as [Schematic](https://github.com/SimonVT/schematic), which significantly reduces the effort.\n\nYou still need to write some parsing code yourself to read the data objects from the Sqlite columns and vice versa. It is possible to serialize the data objects, for instance with Gson, and only persist the resulting string. In this way you lose in performance but on the other hand you do not need to declare a column for all the fields of the data class.\n\n#### Using an ORM\n\nWe generally do not recommend using an Object-Relation Mapping library unless you have unusually complex data and you have a dire need. They tend to be complex and require time to learn. If you decide to go with an ORM you should pay attention to whether or not it is _process safe_ if your application requires it, as many of the existing ORM solutions surprisingly are not.\n\n### Use Stetho \n\n[Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) is a debug bridge for Android applications from Facebook that integrates with the Chrome desktop browser's Developer Tools. With Stetho you can easily inspect your application, most notably the network traffic. It also allows you to easily inspect and edit SQLite databases and the shared preferences in your app. You should, however, make sure that Stetho is only enabled in the debug build and not in the release build variant. \n\nAnother alternative is [Chuck](https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck) which, although offering slightly more simplified functionality, is still useful for testers as the logs are displayed on the device, rather than in the more complicated connected Chrome browser setup that Stetho requires.\n\n### Use LeakCanary\n\n[LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary) is a library that makes runtime detection and identification of memory leaks a more routine part of your application development process. See the library [wiki](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki) for details on configuration and usage. Just remember to configure only the \"no-op\" dependency in your release build!\n\n### Use continuous integration\n\nContinuous integration systems let you automatically build and test your project every time you push updates to version control. Continuous integration also runs static code analysis tools, generates the APK files and distributes them.\n[Lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint.html) and [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) are tools that ensure the code quality while [Findbugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) looks for bugs in the code.\n   \nThere is a wide variety of continuous integration software which provide different features. Pricing plans might be for free if your project is open-sourced.\n[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a good option if you have a local server at your disposal, on the other hand [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is also a recommended choice if you plan to use a cloud-based continuous integration service.\n\n### Thanks to\n\nAntti Lammi, Joni Karppinen, Peter Tackage, Timo Tuominen, Vera Izrailit, Vihtori Mäntylä, Mark Voit, Andre Medeiros, Paul Houghton and other Futurice developers for sharing their knowledge on Android development.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img alt=\"logo\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futurice/spiceprogram/gh-pages/assets/img/logo/chilicorn_no_text-256.png\" width=\"220\"/>\n</p>\n\nThis project is sponsored by [**Spice Program**](http://spiceprogram.org/chilicorn-history/), our open source and social impact program made with love by [**Futurice**](http://www.futurice.com).\n\n### License\n\n[Futurice Oy](http://www.futurice.com)\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\n"

    "text" : "Crosswalk-app-tools\n===================\n\nCrosswalk-app-tools is our forthcoming packaging tool for creating Crosswalk applications. We are inviting early adopters to build their web applications using crosswalk-app-tools, and provide feedback for future improvements.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nThe tools are cross-platform by virtue of being based on Node.js. We are supporting Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X and Linux as host operating systems.\n\nThe following components are required\n  * Node.js and NPM\n  * Android development (APK packages): Android SDK with 5.0 (target-21) or later installed, plus Java JDK and Apache Ant. Supported host systems are Apple OS X, Linux, and Windows.\n  * Windows development (MSI packages): [WiX Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org). MSI installers can only be created on Windows systems.\n\nIn order to get the tools available from the command-line easily, global npm installation is recommended.\n\nMicrosoft Windows: `npm install -g crosswalk-app-tools`\n\nApple OS X and Linux: `sudo npm install -g crosswalk-app-tools`\n\nThe best way to check if a machine has all the required dependencies is to create and build a plain empty Android app \non the system. If this does not work, then building Crosswalk apps will not succeed either. App-tools provides a command for doing this:\n\nCheck Android target setup:\n```\ncrosswalk-app check android\n```\nCheck Windows target setup:\n```\ncrosswalk-app check windows\n```\n\nTwo executables are provided, `crosswalk-app` implements low level helper commands, `crosswalk-pkg` is the main tool for creating packages.\n\n### Usage (crosswalk-pkg --help)\n\n```\n  Crosswalk Project Packaging Tool -- https://crosswalk-project.org\n  Usage: crosswalk-pkg <options> <path>\n\n  <options>\n    -a --android=<android-conf>      Extra configurations for Android\n    -c --crosswalk=<version-spec>    Specify Crosswalk version or path\n    -h --help                        Print usage information\n    -k --keep                        Keep build tree for debugging\n    -m --manifest=<package-id>       Fill manifest.json with default values\n    -p --platforms=<target-systems>  Specify target platform\n    -r --release                     Build release packages\n    -s --skip-check                  Skip host setup check before building\n    -t --targets=<target-archs>      Target CPU architectures\n    -v --version                     Print tool version\n    -w --windows=<windows-conf>      Extra configurations for Windows\n\n  <path>\n    Path to directory that contains a web app\n\n  <android-conf>\n    Quoted string with extra config, e.g. \"shared\"\n    * \"shared\" Build APK that depends on crosswalk in the Google Play Store\n    * \"lite\"   Use crosswalk-lite, see Crosswalk Wiki\n\n  <package-id>\n    Canonical application name, e.g. com.example.foo, needs to\n    * Comprise of 3 or more period-separated parts\n    * Begin with lowecase letters\n\n  <target-archs>\n    List of CPU architectures for which to create packages.\n    Currently supported ABIs are: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64\n    * Prefixes will be matched, so \"a\",\"ar\", or \"arm\" yield both ARM APKs\n    * Same for \"x\" and \"x8\", but \"x86\" is an exact match, only x86-32 conforms\n    * Short-hands \"32\" and \"64\" build ARM and x86 for the requested word size\n    * Default behavior is equivalent to \"32\", creation of 32-bit installers\n    Example: --targets=\"arm x86\" builds both ARM plus 32-bit x86 packages\n\n  <target-systems>\n    List of operating systems for which to create packages.\n    Default is android-only, which is supported on Apple OSX, Linux and Windows\n    Creating Windows MSIs is supported on Microsoft Windows only.\n    Example: --platforms=\"android windows\"\n\n  <version-spec>\n    * Channel name, i.e. stable/beta/canary\n    * Version number, e.g. 14.43.343.25\n    * Path to release, e.g. $HOME/Downloads/crosswalk-14.43.343.25.zip\n    * Path to build, e.g. crosswalk/src/out/Release/xwalk_app_template\n    When passing a local file or directory, only the contained ABIs can be built.\n    See <target-archs> for details.\n\n  <windows-conf>\n    Quoted string with extra config, e.g. \"google-api-key:<name>\"\n    where <name> is the keyset in ~/.crosswalk-app-tools-keys.json\n\n  Environment variables\n    CROSSWALK_APP_TOOLS_CACHE_DIR=<path>: Keep downloaded files in this dir\n```\n### Example: Creating and packaging an application\n\nTo get started, all you need is a web manifest, and an html file. The web manifest holds name and settings for your application. A minimal manifest.json looks like this:\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"My first Crosswalk application\",\n  \"start_url\": \"index.html\",\n  \"xwalk_package_id\": \"com.example.foo\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add an index.html in the same directory:\n```\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My first Crosswalk application</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>This is my first Crosswalk application</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFinally, time to create the APK package:\n```\ncrosswalk-pkg <path>\n```\nCreation of an MSI package on Windows:\n```\ncrosswalk-pkg -p windows <path>\n```\nThis sets up a skeleton project, downloads and imports Crosswalk, and creates a package using the files above.\n\n\n### Next steps and limitations\n* Android release packages will have to be signed manually before they are published on Google's Play Store, as that functionality is not yet integrated. See https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#signing-manually for details.\n* We encourage everyone to use this app-tools and appreciate feedback, as we are looking to improve user friendliness and integration with Crosswalk in the coming releases.\n\n### Additional target platforms\nThere is forthcoming support for additional target platforms. For iOS packaging, see \nhttps://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-app-tools-ios.\n\n### Run development versions from git\n\n1. Download: `npm install https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-app-tools.git`\n4. The main script is `crosswalk-app-tools/src/crosswalk-pkg`. Set environment PATH or invoke with directory.\n\n\n### License\n\nThe license for this project is the Apache License Version 2.0, please refer to the LICENSE-APACHE-V2 included with the package for details.\n"

There is no guarantee that the API returns the\ndevice's actual location.\n\n> To get a few ideas, check out the [sample](#sample) at the bottom of this page or go straight to the [reference](#reference) content.\n\nThis API is based on the\n[W3C Geolocation API Specification](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html).\n\n__WARNING__: Collection and use of geolocation data\nraises important privacy issues.  Your app's privacy policy should\ndiscuss how the app uses geolocation data, whether it is shared with\nany other parties, and the level of precision of the data (for\nexample, coarse, fine, ZIP code level, etc.).  Geolocation data is\ngenerally considered sensitive because it can reveal user's\nwhereabouts and, if stored, the history of their travels.\nTherefore, in addition to the app's privacy policy, you should\nstrongly consider providing a just-in-time notice before the app\naccesses geolocation data (if the device operating system doesn't do\nso already).  That notice should provide the same information noted\nabove, as well as obtaining the user's permission (e.g., by presenting\nchoices for __OK__ and __No Thanks__).  For more information, please\nsee the [Privacy Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/appdev/privacy/index.html).\n\nThis plugin defines a global `navigator.geolocation` object (for platforms\nwhere it is otherwise missing).\n\nAlthough the object is in the global scope, features provided by this plugin\nare not available until after the `deviceready` event.\n\n```javascript\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", onDeviceReady, false);\n    function onDeviceReady() {\n        console.log(\"navigator.geolocation works well\");\n    }\n\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThis requires cordova 5.0+ ( current stable 1.0.0 )\n\n    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation\n\nOlder versions of cordova can still install via the deprecated id ( stale 0.3.12 )\n\n    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation\n\nIt is also possible to install via repo url directly ( unstable )\n\n    cordova plugin add https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation.git\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\n- Android\n- iOS\n- Windows\n\n## Methods\n\n- navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition\n- navigator.geolocation.watchPosition\n- navigator.geolocation.clearWatch\n\n## Objects (Read-Only)\n\n- Position\n- PositionError\n- Coordinates\n\n## navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition\n\nReturns the device's current position to the `geolocationSuccess`\ncallback with a `Position` object as the parameter.  If there is an\nerror, the `geolocationError` callback is passed a\n`PositionError` object.\n\n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geolocationSuccess,\n                                             [geolocationError],\n                                             [geolocationOptions]);\n\n### Parameters\n\n- __geolocationSuccess__: The callback that is passed the current position.\n\n- __geolocationError__: _(Optional)_ The callback that executes if an error occurs.\n\n- __geolocationOptions__: _(Optional)_ The geolocation options.\n\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n\n    // onSuccess Callback\n    // This method accepts a Position object, which contains the\n    // current GPS coordinates\n    //\n    var onSuccess = function(position) {\n        alert('Latitude: '          + position.coords.latitude          + '\\n' +\n              'Longitude: '         + position.coords.longitude         + '\\n' +\n              'Altitude: '          + position.coords.altitude          + '\\n' +\n              'Accuracy: '          + position.coords.accuracy          + '\\n' +\n              'Altitude Accuracy: ' + position.coords.altitudeAccuracy  + '\\n' +\n              'Heading: '           + position.coords.heading           + '\\n' +\n              'Speed: '             + position.coords.speed             + '\\n' +\n              'Timestamp: '         + position.timestamp                + '\\n');\n    };\n\n    // onError Callback receives a PositionError object\n    //\n    function onError(error) {\n        alert('code: '    + error.code    + '\\n' +\n              'message: ' + error.message + '\\n');\n    }\n\n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(onSuccess, onError);\n\n```\n\n### iOS Quirks\n \n Since iOS 10 it's mandatory to provide an usage description in the `info.plist` if trying to access privacy-sensitive data. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this usage description string will displayed as part of the permission dialog box, but if you didn't provide the usage description, the app will crash before showing the dialog. Also, Apple will reject apps that access private data but don't provide an usage description.\n\n This plugins requires the following usage description:\n\n * `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` describes the reason that the app accesses the user's location, this is used while the app is running in the foreground.\n * `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` describes the reason that the app is requesting access to the user’s location information at all times. Use this key if your iOS app accesses location information while running in the background and foreground. \n * `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` describes the reason that the app is requesting access to the user's location at all times. Use this key if your app accesses location information in the background and you deploy to a target earlier than iOS 11. For iOS 11 and later, add both `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` and `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` to your app’s `Info.plist` file with the same message.\n\n To add these entries into the `info.plist`, you can use the `edit-config` tag in the `config.xml` like this:\n\n```\n<edit-config target=\"NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription\" file=\"*-Info.plist\" mode=\"merge\">\n    <string>need location access to find things nearby</string>\n</edit-config>\n```\n```\n<edit-config target=\"NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription\" file=\"*-Info.plist\" mode=\"merge\">\n    <string>need location access to find things nearby</string>\n</edit-config>\n```\n```\n<edit-config target=\"NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription\" file=\"*-Info.plist\" mode=\"merge\">\n    <string>need location access to find things nearby</string>\n</edit-config>\n```\n \n### Android Quirks\n\nFor historic reasons, this plugin requires GPS Hardware on Android devices, so your app will not be able to run on devices without.\nIf you want to use this plugin in your app, but you do not require actual GPS Hardware on the device, install the plugin using the variable *GPS_REQUIRED* set to false:\n\n    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation --variable GPS_REQUIRED=\"false\"\n\nIf Geolocation service is turned off the `onError` callback is invoked after `timeout` interval (if specified).\nIf `timeout` parameter is not specified then no callback is called.\n\n## navigator.geolocation.watchPosition\n\nReturns the device's current position when a change in position is detected.\nWhen the device retrieves a new location, the `geolocationSuccess`\ncallback executes with a `Position` object as the parameter.  If\nthere is an error, the `geolocationError` callback executes with a\n`PositionError` object as the parameter.\n\n    var watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geolocationSuccess,\n                                                      [geolocationError],\n                                                      [geolocationOptions]);\n\n### Parameters\n\n- __geolocationSuccess__: The callback that is passed the current position.\n\n- __geolocationError__: (Optional) The callback that executes if an error occurs.\n\n- __geolocationOptions__: (Optional) The geolocation options.\n\n### Returns\n\n- __String__: returns a watch id that references the watch position interval. The watch id should be used with `navigator.geolocation.clearWatch` to stop watching for changes in position.\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n\n    // onSuccess Callback\n    //   This method accepts a `Position` object, which contains\n    //   the current GPS coordinates\n    //\n    function onSuccess(position) {\n        var element = document.getElementById('geolocation');\n        element.innerHTML = 'Latitude: '  + position.coords.latitude      + '<br />' +\n                            'Longitude: ' + position.coords.longitude     + '<br />' +\n                            '<hr />'      + element.innerHTML;\n    }\n\n    // onError Callback receives a PositionError object\n    //\n    function onError(error) {\n        alert('code: '    + error.code    + '\\n' +\n              'message: ' + error.message + '\\n');\n    }\n\n    // Options: throw an error if no update is received every 30 seconds.\n    //\n    var watchID = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(onSuccess, onError, { timeout: 30000 });\n\n```\n\n## geolocationOptions\n\nOptional parameters to customize the retrieval of the geolocation\n`Position`.\n\n    { maximumAge: 3000, timeout: 5000, enableHighAccuracy: true };\n\n### Options\n\n- __enableHighAccuracy__: Provides a hint that the application needs the best possible results. By default, the device attempts to retrieve a `Position` using network-based methods. Setting this property to `true` tells the framework to use more accurate methods, such as satellite positioning. _(Boolean)_\n\n- __timeout__: The maximum length of time (milliseconds) that is allowed to pass from the call to `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` or `geolocation.watchPosition` until the corresponding `geolocationSuccess` callback executes. If the `geolocationSuccess` callback is not invoked within this time, the `geolocationError` callback is passed a `PositionError.TIMEOUT` error code. (Note that when used in conjunction with `geolocation.watchPosition`, the `geolocationError` callback could be called on an interval every `timeout` milliseconds!) _(Number)_\n\n- __maximumAge__: Accept a cached position whose age is no greater than the specified time in milliseconds. _(Number)_\n\n### Android Quirks\n\nIf Geolocation service is turned off the `onError` callback is invoked after `timeout` interval (if specified).\nIf `timeout` parameter is not specified then no callback is called.\n\n## navigator.geolocation.clearWatch\n\nStop watching for changes to the device's location referenced by the\n`watchID` parameter.\n\n    navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchID);\n\n### Parameters\n\n- __watchID__: The id of the `watchPosition` interval to clear. (String)\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n\n    // Options: watch for changes in position, and use the most\n    // accurate position acquisition method available.\n    //\n    var watchID = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(onSuccess, onError, { enableHighAccuracy: true });\n\n    // ...later on...\n\n    navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchID);\n\n```\n\n## Position\n\nContains `Position` coordinates and timestamp, created by the geolocation API.\n\n### Properties\n\n- __coords__: A set of geographic coordinates. _(Coordinates)_\n\n- __timestamp__: Creation timestamp for `coords`. _(DOMTimeStamp)_\n\n## Coordinates\n\nA `Coordinates` object is attached to a `Position` object that is\navailable to callback functions in requests for the current position.\nIt contains a set of properties that describe the geographic coordinates of a position.\n\n### Properties\n\n* __latitude__: Latitude in decimal degrees. _(Number)_\n\n* __longitude__: Longitude in decimal degrees. _(Number)_\n\n* __altitude__: Height of the position in meters above the ellipsoid. _(Number)_\n\n* __accuracy__: Accuracy level of the latitude and longitude coordinates in meters. _(Number)_\n\n* __altitudeAccuracy__: Accuracy level of the altitude coordinate in meters. _(Number)_\n\n* __heading__: Direction of travel, specified in degrees counting clockwise relative to the true north. _(Number)_\n\n* __speed__: Current ground speed of the device, specified in meters per second. _(Number)_\n\n### Android Quirks\n\n__altitudeAccuracy__: Not supported by Android devices, returning `null`.\n\n## PositionError\n\nThe `PositionError` object is passed to the `geolocationError`\ncallback function when an error occurs with navigator.geolocation.\n\n### Properties\n\n- __code__: One of the predefined error codes listed below.\n\n- __message__: Error message describing the details of the error encountered.\n\n### Constants\n\n- `PositionError.PERMISSION_DENIED`\n  - Returned when users do not allow the app to retrieve position information. This is dependent on the platform.\n- `PositionError.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE`\n  - Returned when the device is unable to retrieve a position. In general, this means the device is not connected to a network or can't get a satellite fix.\n- `PositionError.TIMEOUT`\n  - Returned when the device is unable to retrieve a position within the time specified by the `timeout` included in `geolocationOptions`. When used with `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`, this error could be repeatedly passed to the `geolocationError` callback every `timeout` milliseconds.\n\n\n## <a id=\"sample\"></a>Sample: Get the weather, find stores, and see photos of things nearby with Geolocation ##\n\nUse this plugin to help users find things near them such as Groupon deals, houses for sale, movies playing, sports and entertainment events and more.\n\nHere's a \"cookbook\" of ideas to get you started.

It will help you with development and deploy changes to your Cordova application via hot code push, without the need to submit your changes to the Apple App Store or Google Play.\n\nMain features are:\n- Automatically generate configuration files, required for Hot Code Push plugin (`chcp.json` and `chcp.manifest`).\n- Run local server in order to detect any changes you make in your web project and instantly upload them on the devices.\n- Deploy your web project on the external servers with the single command. For now it only supports deployment on the Amazon servers. More deployment targets will be added later.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [How to use](#how-to-use)\n- [Commands](#commands)\n  - [Init command](#init-command)\n  - [Build command](#build-command)\n  - [Server command](#server-command)\n  - [Login command](#login-command)\n  - [Deploy command](#deploy-command)\n- [Default configuration file](#default-configuration-file)\n- [Ignored files list](#ignored-files-list)\n- [Normal workflow scheme](#normal-workflow-scheme)\n- [Local development workflow scheme](#local-development-workflow-scheme)\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install CLI client using `npm install` (current stable 1.1.1):\n```sh\nnpm install -g cordova-hot-code-push-cli\n```\n\nIt is also possible to install via repo url directly (__unstable__):\n```sh\nnpm install -g https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push-cli.git\n```\n\n### How to use\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp <command>\n```\n\nWhere `<command>` can be:\n- `init` - initialize project parameters, create default `cordova-hcp.json` file.\n- `build` - build project files, generate `chcp.json` and `chcp.manifest` files in the `www` folder. Prepare for deployment.\n- `server` - run local server that is used for local development process.\n- `login` - create login credentials that are used for deployment of project files on the remote server.\n- `deploy` - upload project files on the remote server.\n\nAll commands should be executed in the root folder of your Cordova project. For example, lets assume you have a Cordova `TestProject` with the following structure:\n```\nTestProject/\n  config.xml\n  hooks/\n  node_modules/\n  platforms/\n  plugins/\n  www/\n```\nThen `cordova-hcp` commands should be executed in the `TestProject` folder.\n\n### Commands\n\n#### Init command\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp init\n```\n\nInitialization command for CLI client. Generates default application configuration file (`cordova-hcp.json`) in the projects root folder. This file is used later on for `build` and `deploy`.\n\nWhen executed - you will be asked to fill in some project preferences from the command line:\n- `Project name` - your current project name. **Required**.\n- `Amazon S3 Bucket name` - name of the S3 Bucket on the Amazon. **Required for deployment**, can be skipped in other cases.\n- `Amazon S3 region` - Amazon S3 region. **Required for deployment**, can be skipped in other cases.\n- `iOS app identifier` - applications id on the App Store. Used to redirect user to the applications page on the store.\n- `Android app identifier` - applications package name by which we reference app on the Google Play.\n- `Update method` - when to perform the update. Supports three keys:\n  - `start` - install updates when application is launched;\n  - `resume` - install update when application is resumed (moved from background to foreground state) or launched; **used by default**;\n  - `now` - install update as soon as it is loaded from the server.\n\nFor example, execute `init` in your project root folder and fill preferences as below:\n```\nRunning init\nPlease provide: Enter project name (required):  TestProject\nPlease provide: Amazon S3 Bucket name (required for cordova-hcp deploy):  chcp-test\nPlease provide: Amazon S3 region (required for cordova-hcp deploy):  (us-east-1) eu-west-1\nPlease provide: IOS app identifier:  id123456789\nPlease provide: Android app identifier:  com.example.chcp.testproject\nPlease provide: Update method (required):  (resume) start\nProject initialized and cordova-hcp.json file created.\nIf you wish to exclude files from being published, specify them in .chcpignore\nBefore you can push updates you need to run \"cordova-hcp login\" in project directory\n```\n\nAs a result, content of the `cordova-hcp.json` file will be:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"TestProject\",\n  \"s3bucket\": \"chcp-test\",\n  \"s3region\": \"eu-west-1\",\n  \"ios_identifier\": \"id123456789\",\n  \"android_identifier\": \"com.example.chcp.testproject\",\n  \"update\": \"start\",\n  \"content_url\": \"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/chcp-test\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can skip initialization for local development process when you execute\n```sh\ncordova-hcp server\n```\nMore details about `server` command can be found below.\n\n#### Build command\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp build [www_directory]\n```\n\nwhere:\n- `[www_directory]` - path to the directory with your web project. If not specified - `www` is used.\n\nCommand is used to prepare project for deployment and to generate plugin specific configuration files inside `www` folder:\n- `chcp.json` - holds release related information.\n- `chcp.manifest` - holds information about web project files: their names (relative paths) and hashes.\n\nWhen executed - you will see in the terminal window:\n```\nRunning build\nBuild 2015.09.07-11.20.55 created in /Cordova/TestProject/www\n```\n\nAs a result, `chcp.json` and `chcp.manifest` files are generated in the `www` folder and project is ready for deployment.\n\nMore information about those configs can be found on [Cordova Hot Code Push plugin](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push) documentation page.\n\n#### Server command\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp server [www_directory]\n```\n\nwhere:\n- `[www_directory]` - path to the directory with your web project. If not specified - `www` is used.\n\nCommand is used for local development purpose only. It starts local server that listens for changes inside your web folder (with respect to `.chcpignore`) and sends notification about the new release to the connected users. This way you can develop your application and see results in the real-time.\n\nYou can use `server` without running `init` at first. In that case, application configuration file (`www/chcp.json`) is generated with the default values and `autogenerated` flag:\n```json\n{\n  \"autogenerated\": true,\n  \"release\": \"2015.09.07-12.28.38\",\n  \"content_url\": \"https://19d5cfa2.ngrok.com\",\n  \"update\": \"now\"\n}\n```\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Launch server in the project root by executing:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp server\n  ```\n\n  As a result, you will see something like this:\n  ```\n  Running server\n  Checking:  /Cordova/TestProject/www\n  local_url http://localhost:31284\n  Build 2015.09.07-10.12.25 created in /Cordova/TestProject/www\n  cordova-hcp local server available at: http://localhost:31284\n  cordova-hcp public server available at: https://19d5cfa2.ngrok.com\n  ```\n\n2. Launch application on your emulators or test devices:\n  ```sh\n  cordova run\n  ```\n\n3. When application starts - it connects to the local server via socket. In the servers console window you should see following message:\n  ```sh\n  a user connected\n  ```\n\n4. Open any file from your `www` folder and do some changes in it. For example, change `index.html`. As a result, you will see in the servers console:\n  ```\n  File changed:  /TestProject/www/index.html\n  Build 2015.09.07-10.12.31 created in /TestProject/www\n  Should trigger reload for build: 2015.09.07-10.12.31\n  ```\n\n  This means that `cordova-hcp` detected your changes, executed `build` command and sent notification via socket to the connected users.\n\n5. On the mobile side plugin captures `new release` event through the socket and loads it from the server.\n\n**Note:** if during the development you will add some new plugin to the project - then you have to:\n\n1. Delete old version of the app.\n2. Reinstall the app with `cordova run` command.\n\n#### Login command\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp login\n```\n\nCommand requests and saves login credentials, using which deployment on the Amazon servers is performed. You need to run it before doing any deployment. Otherwise, `cordova-hcp` won't now how to login to the Amazon.\n\nWhen executed, you will be asked to enter your Amazon `Access Key Id` and `Access Key Secret`:\n```\nRunning login\nPlease provide: Amazon Access Key Id:  YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID\nPlease provide: Amazon Secret Access Key:  YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET\n```\n\nEntered credentials will be placed in the `.chcplogin` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"key\": \"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID\",\n  \"secret\": \"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET\"\n}\n```\n\nFrom this point you are ready to deploy your project on Amazon server.\n\n**Advise:** don't forget to put `.chcplogin` file in the ignore list of your version control system, if any is used. For git you can do this by executing:\n```sh\necho '.chcplogin' >> .gitignore\n```\n\n#### Deploy command\n\n```sh\ncordova-hcp deploy [www_directory]\n```\n\nwhere:\n- `[www_directory]` - path to the directory with your web project. If not specified - `www` is used.\n\nCommand uploads your Cordova's web project files on the Amazon server. Can be executed only after `init` and `login` commands.\n\nWhen executed, you will see the following in the console:\n```\nRunning deploy\nConfig { name: 'TestProject',\n  s3bucket: 'chcp-test',\n  s3region: 'eu-west-1',\n  ios_identifier: 'id123456789',\n  android_identifier: 'com.example.chcp.testproject',\n  update: 'start',\n  content_url: 'https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/chcp-test',\n  release: '2015.09.07-13.02.28' }\nBuild 2015.09.07-13.02.28 created in /Cordova/TestProject/www\nDeploy started\nDeploy done\n```\n\nAs a result - all files from your web directory are uploaded to the Amazon server, which was defined on the `init` step.\n\n### Default configuration file\n\nAs mentioned in [Init command](#init-command) section of the readme - after executing `cordova-hcp init` command you will get a default configuration file, called `cordova-hcp.json`. It is created in the root folder of your project. When you run `cordova-hcp build` - data from that file is used to generate `chcp.json` file in `www` folder.\n\nIf you want - you can create `cordova-hcp.json` manually and put in there any options you want. It's just a JSON object like so:\n```json\n{\n  \"update\": \"start\",\n  \"content_url\": \"https://mycoolserver.com/mobile_content/\"\n}\n```\n\nBy default, you would probably put in there your `content_url`. But it can also be any other setting.\n\n### Ignored files list\n\nBy default, CLI client ignores all hidden files, and files from the following list:\n```\nchcp.json\nchcp.manifest\npackage.json\nnode_modules/*\n```\n\nBut if you want - you can extend this list like so:\n\n1. Create `.chcpignore` file in the root of your Cordova Project (for example, `/Cordova/TestProject/.chcpignore`).\n2. Add ignored files. For example:\n\n```\ndirty.html\nimages/*\nlibs/*\n```\nAs a result, those files will be excluded from the `chcp.manifest`, and ignored by the `server` in local development mode.\n\nIf you want - you can add comments by using `#` like this:\n\n```\n# Ignore libraries\nlibs/*\n\n# Ignore images\nimages/*\n```\n\n### Normal workflow scheme\n\n1. Initialize:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp init\n  ```\n\n2. Provide login preferences:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp login\n  ```\n\n3. Build your project:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp build\n  ```\n\n4. Upload project on the server:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp deploy\n  ```\n\n5. When new version is ready - repeat steps `3.` and `4.`.\n\n### Local development workflow scheme\n\n1. Run server:\n  ```sh\n  cordova-hcp server\n  ```\n\n2. Run application:\n  ```sh\n  cordova run\n  ```\n\n3. Do some changes in the `www` folder. Wait for a few moments and see the result on the launched devices (emulators).\n"

The following methods are no longer available: `setCookieConfig`, `getCookieConfig`, `createAnalyticsScriptTag`, and `createScriptTag`. Each have been replaced with alternative implementations that can be found in this documentation.\n\n## Installation and Quick Start\nThe quick start is designed to give you a simple, working example for the most common usage scenario. There are numerous other ways to configure and use this library as explained in the documentation.\n\n### 1- Installation:\nYou can install the module from a package manger of your choice directly from the command line\n\n```sh\n# Bower\nbower install angular-google-analytics\n\n# NPM\nnpm i angular-google-analytics\n\n# Nuget\nnuget install angular-google-analytics\n```\n\nOr alternatively, grab the dist/angular-google-analytics.min.js and include it in your project\n\nIn your application, declare the angular-google-analytics module dependency.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-google-analytics/dist/angular-google-analytics.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### 2- In your application, declare dependency injection:\n\n```javascript\nvar myApp = angular.module('myModule', ['angular-google-analytics']);\n```\n\n### 3- Set your Google Analytics account and start tracking:\n\n```JavaScript\nmyApp.config(['AnalyticsProvider', function (AnalyticsProvider) {\n   // Add configuration code as desired\n   AnalyticsProvider.setAccount('UU-XXXXXXX-X');  //UU-XXXXXXX-X should be your tracking code\n}]).run(['Analytics', function(Analytics) { }]);\n```\nCongratulations! [angular-google-analytics](https://github.com/revolunet/angular-google-analytics) is ready and Google Analytics will track your page views once the application is run\n\n## Configure Service\n```js\napp.config(function (AnalyticsProvider) {\n  // Add configuration code as desired - see below\n});\n```\n\n### Configuration Method Chaining\n```js\n  // All configuration methods return the provider object and can be chained to reduce typing.\n  // For example:\n  AnalyticsProvider\n    .logAllCalls(true)\n    .startOffline(true)\n    .useECommerce(true, true);\n```\n\n### Use Classic Analytics\n```js\n// Use ga.js (classic) instead of analytics.js (universal)\n// By default, universal analytics is used, unless this is called with a falsey value.\nAnalyticsProvider.useAnalytics(false);\n```\n\n### Set Google Analytics Accounts (Required)\n```js\n// Set a single account\nAnalyticsProvider.setAccount('UA-XXXXX-xx');\n```\n**Note:** the single account syntax is internally represented as an unnamed account object that will have all properties defined to defaults, except for name.\n\n```js\n// Set multiple accounts\n// Universal Analytics only\nAnalyticsProvider.setAccount([\n   { tracker: 'UA-12345-12', name: \"tracker1\" },\n   { tracker: 'UA-12345-34', name: \"tracker2\" }\n]);\n```\n**Note:** the above account objects will have all properties defined to defaults that are not defined.\n\n```js\n// Set a single account with all properties defined\n// Universal Analytics only\nAnalyticsProvider.setAccount({\n  tracker: 'UA-12345-12',\n  name: \"tracker1\",\n  fields: {\n    cookieDomain: 'foo.example.com',\n    cookieName: 'myNewName',\n    cookieExpires: 20000\n    // See: [Analytics Field Reference](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference) for a list of all fields.\n  },\n  crossDomainLinker: true,\n  crossLinkDomains: ['domain-1.com', 'domain-2.com'],\n  displayFeatures: true,\n  enhancedLinkAttribution: true,\n  select: function (args) {\n    // This function is used to qualify or disqualify an account object to be run with commands.\n    // If the function does not exist, is not a function, or returns true then the account object will qualify.\n    // If the function exists and returns false then the account object will be disqualified.\n    // The 'args' parameter is the set of arguments (which contains the command name) that will be sent to Universal Analytics.\n    return true;\n  },\n  set: {\n    forceSSL: true\n    // This is any set of `set` commands to make for the account immediately after the `create` command for the account.\n    // The property key is the command and the property value is passed in as the argument, _e.g._, `ga('set', 'forceSSL', true)`.\n    // Order of commands is not guaranteed as it is dependent on the implementation of the `for (property in object)` iterator.\n  },\n  trackEvent: true,\n  trackEcommerce: true\n});\n```\n**Note:** the above properties are referenced and discussed in proceeding sections.\n\n### Use Display Features\n```js\n  // Use display features module\n  AnalyticsProvider.useDisplayFeatures(true);\n```\n\nIf set to a truthy value then the display features module is loaded with Google Analytics.\n\nIn the case of universal analytics, this value will be used as the default for any tracker that does not have the `displayFeatures` property defined. All trackers with `displayFeatures: true` will be registered for display features.\n\n### Use Enhanced Link Attribution\n```js\n  // Enable enhanced link attribution module\n  AnalyticsProvider.useEnhancedLinkAttribution(true);\n```\n\nIf set to a truthy value then the enhanced link attribution module is loaded with Google Analytics.\n\nIn the case of universal analytics, this value will be used as the default for any tracker that does not have the `enhancedLinkAttribution` property defined. All trackers with `enhancedLinkAttribution: true` will be registered for enhanced link attribution.\n\n### Use Cross Domain Linking\n```js\n  // Use cross domain linking and set cross-linked domains\n  AnalyticsProvider.useCrossDomainLinker(true);\n  AnalyticsProvider.setCrossLinkDomains(['domain-1.com', 'domain-2.com']);\n```\n\nIf set to a truthy value then the cross-linked domains are registered with Google Analytics.\n\nIn the case of universal analytics, these values will be used as the default for any tracker that does not have the `crossDomainLinker` and `crossLinkDomains` properties defined. All trackers with `crossDomainLinker: true` will register the cross-linked domains.\n\n### Track Events\nThis property is defined for universal analytics account objects only and is false by default.\n\nIf `trackEvent: true` for an account object then all `trackEvent` calls will be supported for that account object.\n\nSet `trackEvent: false` for an account object that is not tracking events.\n\n### Track E-Commerce\nThis property is defined for universal analytics account objects only. This property defaults to true if e-commerce is enabled (either classic or enhanced) and false otherwise.\n\nIf `trackEcommerce: true` for an account object then all e-commerce calls will be supported for that account object.\n\nSet `trackEcommerce: false` for an account object that is not tracking e-commerce.\n\n### Enable E-Commerce\n```js\n  // Enable e-commerce module (ecommerce.js)\n  AnalyticsProvider.useECommerce(true, false);\n\n  // Enable enhanced e-commerce module (ec.js)\n  // Universal Analytics only\n  AnalyticsProvider.useECommerce(true, true);\n\n  // Set Currency\n  // Default is 'USD'. Use ISO currency codes.\n  AnalyticsProvider.setCurrency('CDN');\n```\n**Note:** When enhanced e-commerce is enabled, the legacy e-commerce module is disabled and unsupported. This is a requirement of Google Analytics.\n\n### Set Route Tracking Behaviors\n**Note:** In order to set route tracking behavior in the $routeProvider you need the ngRoute module in your application. Please refer\nto the official [angular ngRoute documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute) on how to install and use this service.\n```js\n  // Track all routes (default is true).\n  AnalyticsProvider.trackPages(true);\n\n  // Track all URL query params (default is false).\n  AnalyticsProvider.trackUrlParams(true);\n\n  // Ignore first page view (default is false).\n  // Helpful when using hashes and whenever your bounce rate looks obscenely low.\n  AnalyticsProvider.ignoreFirstPageLoad(true);\n\n  // URL prefix (default is empty).\n  // Helpful when the app doesn't run in the root directory.\n  AnalyticsProvider.trackPrefix('my-application');\n\n  // Change the default page event name.\n  // Helpful when using ui-router, which fires $stateChangeSuccess instead of $routeChangeSuccess.\n  AnalyticsProvider.setPageEvent('$stateChangeSuccess');\n\n  // RegEx to scrub location before sending to analytics.\n  // Internally replaces all matching segments with an empty string.\n  AnalyticsProvider.setRemoveRegExp(/\\/\\d+?$/);\n\n  // Activate reading custom tracking urls from $routeProvider config (default is false)\n  // This is more flexible than using RegExp and easier to maintain for multiple parameters.\n  // It also reduces tracked pages to routes (only those with a templateUrl) defined in the\n  // $routeProvider and therefore reduces bounce rate created by redirects.\n  // NOTE: The following option requires the ngRoute module\n  AnalyticsProvider.readFromRoute(true);\n  // Add custom routes to the $routeProvider like this. You can also exclude certain routes from tracking by\n  // adding 'doNotTrack' property\n  $routeProvider\n    .when('/sessions', {\n      templateUrl: 'list.html',\n      controller: 'ListController'\n    })\n    .when('/session/:id',{\n      templateUrl : 'master.html',\n      controller: 'MasterController',\n      pageTrack: '/session'  // angular-google-analytics extension\n    })\n    .when('/member/:sessionId/:memberId', {\n      templateUrl : 'member.html',\n      controller: 'CardController',\n      pageTrack: '/member',  // angular-google-analytics extension\n    })\n    .otherwise({\n      templateUrl: '404.html',\n      doNotTrack: true       // angular-google-analytics extension\n    });\n```\n\n### Set Domain Name\n```js\n  // Set the domain name\n  AnalyticsProvider.setDomainName('XXX');\n```\n**Note:** Use the string `'none'` for testing on localhost.\n\n### Enable Experiment (universal analytics only)\n```js\n  // Enable analytics.js experiments\n  AnalyticsProvider.setExperimentId('12345');\n```\n**Note:** only a single experiment can be defined.\n\n### Support Hybrid Mobile Applications (universal analytics only)\n```js\n  // Set hybrid mobile application support\n  AnalyticsProvider.setHybridMobileSupport(true);\n```\n\nIf set to a truthy value then each account object will disable protocol checking and all injected scripts will use the HTTPS protocol.\n\n### Delay Script Tag Insertion and Tracker Setup\n```js\n  // Must manually call registerScriptTags method in order to insert the Google Analytics scripts on the page.\n  //   Analytics.registerScriptTags();\n  // Must manually call registerTrackers method in order to setup the trackers with Google Analytics.\n  //   Analytics.registerTrackers();\n  // Helpful when needing to do advanced configuration or user opt-out and wanting explicit control\n  // over when the Google Analytics scripts get injected or tracker setup happens.\n  AnalyticsProvider.delayScriptTag(true);\n```\n\n### Offline Mode\n```js\n  // Start in offline mode if set to true. This also calls delayScriptTag(true) since the script cannot be\n  // fetched if offline and must be manually called when the application goes online.\n  AnalyticsProvider.startOffline(true);\n```\n\n### Disable Analytics / User Opt-out\n```js\n  // Disable analytics data gathering via the user opt-out feature in Google Analytics. More information on this\n  // is available here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/advanced#optout.\n  AnalyticsProvider.disableAnalytics(true);\n```\n\n**Note:** Using this configuration option requires that you already know the user wants to opt-out before the analytics script is injected on the page. This is somewhat unlikely for most use cases given the nature of a single page application. This module provides a better alternative with `Offline` mode since you can effectively opt the user out of tracking by enabling offline mode at any time during execution.\n\n### Service Logging\n```js\n  // Log all outbound calls to an in-memory array accessible via ```Analytics.log``` (default is false).\n  // This is useful for troubleshooting and seeing the order of calls with parameters.\n  AnalyticsProvider.logAllCalls(true);\n```\n\n### Test Mode\n```js\n  // This method is designed specifically for unit testing and entering test mode cannot be changed after\n  // being called. Test mode skips the insertion of the Google Analytics script tags (both classic and universal)\n  // and ensures there is a $window.ga() method available for calling by unit tests. This corrects transient\n  // errors that were seen during unit tests due to the operation of the Google Analytics scripts.\n  AnalyticsProvider.enterTestMode();\n```\n\n### Debug Mode\n```js\n  // Calling this method will enable debugging mode for Universal Analytics. Supplying a truthy value for the\n  // optional parameter will further enable trace debugging for Universal Analytics. More information on this\n  // is available here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/debugging.\n  AnalyticsProvider.enterDebugMode(Boolean);\n```\n\n### Anonymize IP\n```js\nAnalyticsProvider.setAccount({\n  tracker: 'UA-12345-12',\n  set: {\n    anonymizeIp: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Using the Analytics Service\n**IMPORTANT!** Due to how Google Analytics works, it is important to remember that you must always call `Analytics.pageView();` when you want to push setting changes and function calls to Google Analytics.\n\n### Automatic Page View Tracking\nIf you are relying on automatic page tracking, you need to inject Analytics at least once in your application.\n```js\n  // As an example, add the service to the run call:\n  app.run(function(Analytics) {});\n```\n\n### Declaring a Controller\n```js\n  // As an example, a simple controller to make calls from:\n  app.controller('SampleController', function (Analytics) {\n    // Add calls as desired - see below\n  });\n```\n\n### Accessing Configuration Settings\nThe following configuration settings are intended to be immutable. While the values can be changed in this list by the user, this will not impact the behavior of the service as these values are not referenced internally; exceptions are noted below but are not intended to be utilized in such a way by the user. No guarantee will be made for future versions of this service supporting any functionality beyond reading values from this list.\n```js\n  // This is a mutable array. Changes to this list will impact service behaviors.\n  Analytics.configuration.accounts;\n\n  // If `true` then universal analytics is being used.\n  // If `false` then classic analytics is being used.\n  Analytics.configuration.universalAnalytics;\n\n  Analytics.configuration.crossDomainLinker;\n  Analytics.configuration.crossLinkDomains;\n  Analytics.configuration.currency;\n  Analytics.configuration.debugMode;\n\n  Analytics.configuration.delayScriptTag;\n  Analytics.configuration.disableAnalytics;\n  Analytics.configuration.displayFeatures;\n  Analytics.configuration.domainName;\n\n  // ecommerce and enhancedEcommerce are mutually exclusive; either both will be false or one will be true.\n  Analytics.configuration.ecommerce;\n  Analytics.configuration.enhancedEcommerce;\n\n  Analytics.configuration.enhancedLinkAttribution;\n  Analytics.configuration.experimentId;\n  Analytics.configuration.ignoreFirstPageLoad;\n  Analytics.configuration.logAllCalls;\n  Analytics.configuration.pageEvent;\n  Analytics.configuration.removeRegExp;\n  Analytics.configuration.traceDebuggingMode;\n  Analytics.configuration.trackPrefix;\n  Analytics.configuration.trackRoutes;\n  Analytics.configuration.trackUrlParams;\n```\n\n### Get URL\n```js\n  // Returns the current URL that would be sent if a `trackPage` call was made.\n  // The returned value takes into account all configuration settings that modify the URL.\n  Analytics.getUrl();\n```\n\n### Manual Script Tag Injection and Tracker Setup\nIf `delayScriptTag(true)` was set during configuration then manual script tag injection and tracker setup is required. Otherwise, the script tag and trackers will be automatically injected and configured when the service is instantiated.\n```js\n  // Manually create either classic analytics (ga.js) or universal analytics (analytics.js) script tags\n  Analytics.registerScriptTags();\n\n  // Manually setup the tracker object(s)\n  Analytics.registerTrackers();\n```\n\n### Advanced Settings / Custom Dimensions\nThe `set` call allows for advanced configuration and definitions in universal analytics only. This is a no-op when using classic analytics.\n```js\n  // Set the User Id\n  Analytics.set('&uid', 1234);\n\n  // Register a custom dimension for the default, unnamed account object\n  // e.g., ga('set', 'dimension1', 'Paid');\n  Analytics.set('dimension1', 'Paid');\n\n  // Register a custom dimenstion for a named account object\n  // e.g., ga('accountName.set', 'dimension2', 'Paid');\n  Analytics.set('dimension2', 'Paid', 'accountName');\n```\n\n### Page Tracking\n```js\n  // Create a new pageview event\n  Analytics.trackPage('/video/detail/XXX');\n\n  // Create a new pageview event with page title\n  Analytics.trackPage('/video/detail/XXX', 'Video XXX');\n\n  // Create a new pageview event with page title, custom dimension, and custom metric\n  // Universal Analytics only\n  Analytics.trackPage('/video/detail/XXX', 'Video XXX', { dimension15: 'My Custom Dimension', metric18: 8000 });\n```\n\n### Event Tracking\n```js\n  // Create a new tracking event\n  Analytics.trackEvent('video', 'play', 'django.mp4');\n\n  // Create a new tracking event with a value\n  Analytics.trackEvent('video', 'play', 'django.mp4', 4);\n\n  // Create a new tracking event with a value and non-interaction flag\n  Analytics.trackEvent('video', 'play', 'django.mp4', 4, true);\n\n  // Create a new tracking event with a value, non-interaction flag, custom dimension, and custom metric\n  // Universal Analytics only\n  Analytics.trackEvent('video', 'play', 'django.mp4', 4, true, { dimension15: 'My Custom Dimension', metric18: 8000 });\n  \n  // Track an event that is an outbound transport request\n  Analytics.trackEvent(\n    'video',\n    'play',\n    'django.mp4',\n    4,\n    true,\n    {\n      dimension15: 'My Custom Dimension',\n      metric18: 8000,\n      transport: 'beacon',\n      hitCallback: function () {\n        document.location = 'http://google.com';\n      }\n    }\n  );\n```\n\n### Track User Timings\nThe `trackTimings` call is available for universal analytics only. This is a no-op when using classic analytics.\n```js\n  Analytics.trackTimings(timingCategory, timingVar, timingValue, timingLabel);\n\n  // example:\n  var endTime = new Date().getTime(),\n      timeSpent = endTime - startTime;\n  Analytics.trackTimings('Time to Checkout', 'User Timings', timeSpent);\n```\n\n### Classic E-Commerce (ecommerce.js)\nClassic e-commerce and enhanced e-commerce are mutually exclusive.\n```js\n  // Create transaction\n  Analytics.addTrans('1', '', '2.42', '0.42', '0', 'Amsterdam', '', 'Netherlands', 'EUR');\n\n  // Add items to transaction\n  Analytics.addItem('1', 'sku-1', 'Test product 1', 'Testing', '1', '1');\n  Analytics.addItem('1', 'sku-2', 'Test product 2', 'Testing', '1', '1');\n\n  // Complete transaction\n  Analytics.trackTrans();\n\n  // Clear transaction\n  Analytics.clearTrans();\n```\n\n### Enhanced E-Commerce (ec.js)\nEnhanced e-commerce is only available for universal analytics. Enhanced e-commerce and classic e-commerce are mutually exclusive.\n\n#### Product Impression Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addImpression(productId, name, list, brand, category, variant, position, price);\n  Analytics.pageView();\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addImpression('sku-1', 'Test Product 1', 'Category List', 'Brand 1', 'Category-1', 'variant-1', '1', '24990');\n  Analytics.addImpression('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category List', 'Brand 2', 'Category-1', 'variant-3', '2', '2499');\n  Analytics.pageView();\n```\n\n#### Product Click Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position, custom);\n  Analytics.productClick(listName);\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.productClick('Search Result');\n\n  // example with custom dimension and metric:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1', { dimension4: 'strong', metric2: 5 });\n  Analytics.productClick('Search Result');\n```\n\n#### Product Detail Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position);\n  Analytics.trackDetail();\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.trackDetail();\n```\n\n#### Add to Cart Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position);\n  Analytics.trackCart('add', listName); // listname is optional\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.trackCart('add', 'Search Result');\n```\n\n#### Remove from Cart Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position);\n  Analytics.trackCart('remove', listName); // listname is optional\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.trackCart('remove', 'Search Result');\n```\n\n#### Checkout Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position);\n  Analytics.trackCheckout(checkoutStep, optionValue);\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2499', '1', 'FLAT10', '1');\n  Analytics.trackCheckout(1, 'Visa');\n```\n\n#### Transaction Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.addProduct(productId, name, category, brand, variant, price, quantity, coupon, position);\n  Analytics.trackTransaction(transactionId, affiliation, revenue, tax, shipping, coupon, list, step, option);\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '2222', '1', 'MEN10', '1');\n  Analytics.addProduct('sku-2', 'Test Product 2', 'Category-1', 'Brand 2', 'variant-3', '1111', '1', 'WOMEN10', '1');\n  Analytics.trackTransaction('T1234', 'Online Store - Web', '3333', '10', '200', 'FLAT10', '', '', '');\n```\n\n#### Promotion Impressions\n```js\n  Analytics.addPromo(productId, name, creative, position);\n  Analytics.pageView();\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addPromo('PROMO_1234', 'Summer Sale', 'summer_banner2', 'banner_slot1');\n  Analytics.pageView();\n```\n**Note:** Before tracking promotion clicks, call pageView, otherwise promotion impressions will be treated as promotion clicks.\n\n#### Promotion Clicks\n```js\n  Analytics.addPromo(promotionId, promotionName, creative, position);\n  Analytics.promoClick(promotionName);\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.addPromo('PROMO_1234', 'Summer Sale', 'summer_banner2', 'banner_slot1');\n  Analytics.promoClick('Summer Sale');\n```\n\n### Exception Tracking\n```js\n  Analytics.trackException(description, isFatal);\n\n  // example:\n  Analytics.trackException('Function \"foo\" is undefined on object \"bar\"', true);\n```\n\n### Online / Offline Mode\n```js\n  // While in offline mode, no calls to the ga function or pushes to the gaq array are made.\n  // This will queue all calls for later sending once offline mode is reset to false.\n  Analytics.offline(true);\n\n  // Reset offline mode to false\n  Analytics.offline(false);\n```\n\n### In-Memory Queues\n```js\n  // If logging is enabled then all outbound calls are accessible via an in-memory array.\n  // This is useful for troubleshooting and seeing the order of outbound calls with parameters.\n  Analytics.log;\n\n  // If in offline mode then all calls are queued to an in-memory array for future processing.\n  // All calls queued to the offlineQueue are not outbound calls yet and hence do not show up in the log.\n  Analytics.offlineQueue;\n```\n\n## Directive\n\nAlternatively, you can use a directive to avoid filling controllers with `Analytics.trackEvent();` statements.\n\n**Note:** the directive does not create an isolate scope.\n\n```html\n  <button type=\"button\" ga-track-event=\"['video', 'play', 'django.mp4']\"></button>\n\n  <!-- OR -->\n\n  <button type=\"button\" ga-track-event=\"['video', 'play', 'django.mp4', 4, true, {dimension15: 'My Custom Dimension', metric18: 8000}]\"></button>\n```\n\nYou can define the properties on your controller too, `$scope.event = ['video', 'play', 'django.mp4']` and reference them.\n\n```html\n  <button type=\"button\" ga-track-event=\"event\"></button>\n```\n\n`ga-track-event-if` is a conditional check. If the attribute value evaluates falsey, the event will **NOT** be fired. This is useful for user tracking opt-out, _etc._\n\n```html\n  <button type=\"button\" ga-track-event=\"['video', 'play', 'django.mp4']\" ga-track-event-if=\"shouldTrack\"></button>\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### AdBlock EasyPrivacy\n\nAdBlock has a module named [EasyPrivacy](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt) that is meant to block web tracking scripts. angular-google-analytics.js gets filtered out by the EasyPrivacy blacklist.\n\nUsers who are already concatenating and minifying their scripts should not notice a problem as long as the new script name is not also on the EasyPrivacy blacklist. Alternatively, consider changing the file name manually.\n\n### Debugging Resources\n\nChrome Extension: [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna)\nFirefox Add-on: [Google Analytics Debugger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gadebugger/)\n\n## License\n\nAs AngularJS itself, this module is released under the permissive [MIT License](http://revolunet.mit-license.org). Your contributions are always welcome.\n\n## Development\n\nAfter forking you will need to run the following from a command line to get your environment setup:\n\n1. ```npm install```\n\nAfter install you have the following commands available to you from a command line:\n\n1. ```npm run-script lint```\n2. ```npm test```\n3. ```npm run-script test-server```\n4. ```npm run-script build``` or ```npm run-script release```\n5. ```npm run-script stage```\n"

    "text" : "# Introducing Unicorn Battle\nThis repository is the home of Unicorn Battle (UB), PlayFab's open-source, end-to-end demo project. UB is a complete game sporting dynamic gameplay, driven by PlayFab's back-end technology, showcasing how to build modern live-game systems. \n\n![Splash Screen](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/wiki/Assets/Images/SplashScreen_01.png \"Splash Screen\")\n\n## Key Features\n  * **Unified Player Profile** - Accounts uses Device ID &/or Facebook Authentication\n  * **Cloud Saving** - Store data on up to 10 characters per account\n  * **Inventory Management** - Transfer items and currency between the player and its characters\n  * **Dynamic Gameplay** - Drive client behaviors using TitleData\n  * **Virtual Items, Currencies, and Stores** - Configured via PlayFab's Game Manager\n  * **Friend Lists** - Import Facebook friends or add your own\n  * **Statistics Tracking** - Used to drive Achievements and real-time leaderboards\n  * **Push Notifications** - for re-engagement campaigns and special offers\n  * **Real-money, In-app Purchases** - with Android or iOS receipt validation\n  * **CDN-hosted AssetBundles** - Dynamically stream content to clients for new sales and events\n  * **Cloud-hosted Logic** - Cloud Script methods that call a variety of  protected APIs\n  * **Community Forums** - with API access to your game; built by our partners over at [Innervate](https://playfab.com/marketplace/innervate/\"A turn-key community solution that comes out-of-the-box integrated with PlayFab\")\n\n![Battle](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/wiki/Assets/Images/Battle2.png \"Battle\")\n\n## Configuration and Setup\n### Prerequisites:\nThis is an advanced example and can be quite dense at times due to the many sub-systems. \n\n- You should be very familiar with Unity3d & UUI \n- Have a [basic understanding](https://api.playfab.com/) of the PlayFab API\n- Be comfortable working with JSON-to-C# serialization & deserialization\n\n### Back-end Setup:\nThe first step is cloning the Unicorn Battle back-end to your own PlayFab title so you can play around with all the data on your own.\n\nWe've built a [handy tool](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/tree/master/UB_Uploader \"https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/tree/master/UB_Uploader\") to do this -- see the [Back-end guide](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/wiki/1-Unicorn-Battle-Backend-Guide) for full instructions.\n\n### Client Setup:\nThe next step is to get the Unicorn Battle client running on your own mobile device, and communicating with your own back-end.\n\nThere are two ways to setup the Unicorn Battle client. You can download the Unity source code, compile it yourself, and run on the device of your choice. Or, you can download and install our precompiled Unicorn Battle app directly from the Google Play store for Android.\n\nSee the [Client Guide](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/wiki/2-Unicorn-Battle-Client-Guide) for full instructions.\n\n## More information:\nFor a complete list of available APIs, check out the [online documentation](http://api.playfab.com/).\n\nOur Developer Success Team can assist with answering any questions as well as process any feedback you have about PlayFab services.\n[Community, Forums, Support and Knowledge Base](https://support.playfab.com/support/home)\n\n## Copyright and Licensing Information:\n\n  Apache License -- \n  Version 2.0, January 2004\n  http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n  License Details available in [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnicornBattle/blob/master/LICENSE \"Apache 2.0 License\")\n\n### Third-Party Code Attribution:\nThe asset creators below retain all rights to their assets.

Please try to isolate debug lines related to your issue.\nInstructions for how to prepare debug logs can be found in section [Debugging](#debugging).\nIf you're reporting an app crash, debug logs might not contain all the necessary information about the cause of the crash.\nIn that case, also provide relevant parts of output of `adb logcat` command.\n\n## Issue Hunt\n\nFund your issues or feature request to drag attraction of developers. Checkout our [issue hunt page](https://issuehunt.io/r/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/issues).\n\n# Android background service issues\nThere are repeatedly reported issues with some android devices not working in the background. Check if your device model is on  [dontkillmyapp list](https://dontkillmyapp.com) before you report new issue. For more information check out [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/problem).\n\nAnother confusing fact about Android services is concept of foreground services. Foreground service in context of Android OS is different thing than background geolocation service of this plugin (they're related thought). **Plugin's background geolocation service** actually **becomes foreground service** when app is in the background. Confusing, right? :D\n\nIf service wants to continue to run in the background, it must \"promote\" itself to `foreground service`. Foreground services must have visible notification, which is the reason, why you can't disable drawer notification.\n\nThe notification can only be disabled, when app is running in the foreground, by setting config option `startForeground: false` (this is the default option), but will always be visible in the background (if service was started).\n\nRecommend you to read https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background\n\n## Description\nReact Native fork of [cordova-plugin-background-geolocation](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation)\nwith battery-saving \"circular region monitoring\" and \"stop detection\".\n\nThis plugin can be used for geolocation when the app is running in the foreground or background.\n\nYou can choose from following location providers:\n* **DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER**\n* **ACTIVITY_PROVIDER**\n* **RAW_PROVIDER**\n\nSee [Which provider should I use?](/PROVIDERS.md) for more information about providers.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nVersions of libraries and sdk versions used to compile this plugin can be overriden in\n`android/build.gradle` with ext declaration.\n\nWhen ext is not provided then following defaults will be used:\n\n```\next {\n  compileSdkVersion = 28\n  buildToolsVersion = \"28.0.3\"\n  targetSdkVersion = 28\n  minSdkVersion = 16\n  supportLibVersion = \"28.0.0\"\n  googlePlayServicesVersion = \"11+\"\n}\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDue to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, this module will support\nonly the latest version of React Native. Older versions will only be supported if they're\ncompatible with this module.\n\n| Module           | React Native      |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| 0.1.0 - 0.2.0    | 0.33              |\n| >=0.3.0          | >=0.47            |\n| >=0.6.0          | >=0.60            |\n\nIf you are using an older version of React Native with this module some features may be buggy.\n\nIf you are using `react-native-maps` or another lib that requires `Google Play Services` such as `Exponent.js`, then in addition to the instalation steps described here, you must set `Google Play Services` library version to match the version used by those libraries. (in this case `9.8.0`)\n\nAdd following to `android/build.gradle`\n```\next {\n  googlePlayServicesVersion = \"9.8.0\"\n}\n```\n\n## Example Apps\n\nThe repository [react-native-background-geolocation-example](https://github.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation-example) hosts an example app for both iOS and Android platform.\n\n## Quick example\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Alert } from 'react-native';\nimport BackgroundGeolocation from '@mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation';\n\nclass BgTracking extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    BackgroundGeolocation.configure({\n      desiredAccuracy: BackgroundGeolocation.HIGH_ACCURACY,\n      stationaryRadius: 50,\n      distanceFilter: 50,\n      notificationTitle: 'Background tracking',\n      notificationText: 'enabled',\n      debug: true,\n      startOnBoot: false,\n      stopOnTerminate: true,\n      locationProvider: BackgroundGeolocation.ACTIVITY_PROVIDER,\n      interval: 10000,\n      fastestInterval: 5000,\n      activitiesInterval: 10000,\n      stopOnStillActivity: false,\n      url: 'http://192.168.81.15:3000/location',\n      httpHeaders: {\n        'X-FOO': 'bar'\n      },\n      // customize post properties\n      postTemplate: {\n        lat: '@latitude',\n        lon: '@longitude',\n        foo: 'bar' // you can also add your own properties\n      }\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('location', (location) => {\n      // handle your locations here\n      // to perform long running operation on iOS\n      // you need to create background task\n      BackgroundGeolocation.startTask(taskKey => {\n        // execute long running task\n        // eg. ajax post location\n        // IMPORTANT: task has to be ended by endTask\n        BackgroundGeolocation.endTask(taskKey);\n      });\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('stationary', (stationaryLocation) => {\n      // handle stationary locations here\n      Actions.sendLocation(stationaryLocation);\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('error', (error) => {\n      console.log('[ERROR] BackgroundGeolocation error:', error);\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('start', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service has been started');\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('stop', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service has been stopped');\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('authorization', (status) => {\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation authorization status: ' + status);\n      if (status !== BackgroundGeolocation.AUTHORIZED) {\n        // we need to set delay or otherwise alert may not be shown\n        setTimeout(() =>\n          Alert.alert('App requires location tracking permission', 'Would you like to open app settings?', [\n            { text: 'Yes', onPress: () => BackgroundGeolocation.showAppSettings() },\n            { text: 'No', onPress: () => console.log('No Pressed'), style: 'cancel' }\n          ]), 1000);\n      }\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('background', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] App is in background');\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('foreground', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] App is in foreground');\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('abort_requested', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] Server responded with 285 Updates Not Required');\n\n      // Here we can decide whether we want stop the updates or not.\n      // If you've configured the server to return 285, then it means the server does not require further update.\n      // So the normal thing to do here would be to `BackgroundGeolocation.stop()`.\n      // But you might be counting on it to receive location updates in the UI, so you could just reconfigure and set `url` to null.\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.on('http_authorization', () => {\n      console.log('[INFO] App needs to authorize the http requests');\n    });\n\n    BackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(status => {\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service is running', status.isRunning);\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation services enabled', status.locationServicesEnabled);\n      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation auth status: ' + status.authorization);\n\n      // you don't need to check status before start (this is just the example)\n      if (!status.isRunning) {\n        BackgroundGeolocation.start();

However it does it only for single module.\nAs plugin depends on additional 'common' module, it is required to link it with:\n\n```\nnode ./node_modules/@mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/scripts/postlink.js\n```\n\n### Manual setup\n\n#### Android setup\n\nIn `android/settings.gradle`\n\n```gradle\n...\ninclude ':@mauron85_react-native-background-geolocation-common'\nproject(':@mauron85_react-native-background-geolocation-common').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/android/common')\ninclude ':@mauron85_react-native-background-geolocation'\nproject(':@mauron85_react-native-background-geolocation').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/android/lib')\n...\n```\n\nIn `android/app/build.gradle`\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    ...\n    compile project(':@mauron85_react-native-background-geolocation')\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nRegister the module (in `MainApplication.java`)\n\n```java\nimport com.marianhello.bgloc.react.BackgroundGeolocationPackage;  // <--- Import Package\n\npublic class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n  ...\n  /**\n   * A list of packages used by the app. If the app uses additional views\n   * or modules besides the default ones, add more packages here.\n   */\n  @Override\n  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n          new MainReactPackage(),\n          new BackgroundGeolocationPackage() // <---- Add the Package\n      );\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n#### iOS setup\n\n1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`\n2. Add `./node_modules/@mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/ios/RCTBackgroundGeolocation.xcodeproj`\n3. In the XCode project navigator, select your project, select the `Build Phases` tab and in the `Link Binary With Libraries` section add **libRCTBackgroundGeolocation.a**\n4. Add `UIBackgroundModes` **location** to `Info.plist`\n5. Add `NSMotionUsageDescription` **App requires motion tracking** to `Info.plist` (required by ACTIVITY_PROVIDER)\n\nFor iOS before version 11:\n\n6. Add `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` **App requires background tracking** to `Info.plist`\n\nFor iOS 11:\n\n6. Add `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` **App requires background tracking** to `Info.plist`\n7. Add `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` **App requires background tracking** to `Info.plist`\n\n## API\n\n### configure(options, success, fail)\n\n| Parameter | Type          | Platform | Description                                                                     |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `options` | `JSON Object` | all      | Configure options                                                               |\n\nConfigure options:\n\n| Parameter                 | Type              | Platform     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Provider*   | Default                    | \n|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| `locationProvider`        | `Number`          | all          | Set location provider **@see** [PROVIDERS](/PROVIDERS.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | N/A         | DISTANCE\\_FILTER\\_PROVIDER | \n| `desiredAccuracy`         | `Number`          | all          | Desired accuracy in meters.

When the App is in foreground or background, in addition to storing location in local db,\nthe location callback function is triggered. The number of locations stored in db is limited by `option.maxLocations` and never exceeds this number.\nInstead, old locations are replaced by new ones.\n\nWhen `option.url` is defined, each location is also immediately posted to url defined by `option.url`.\nIf the post is successful, the location is marked as deleted in local db.\n\nWhen `option.syncUrl` is defined, all locations that fail to post will be coalesced and sent in some time later in a single batch.\nBatch sync takes place only when the number of failed-to-post locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`.\nLocations are sent only in single batch when the number of locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`. (No individual locations will be sent)\n\nThe request body of posted locations is always an array, even when only one location is sent.\n\nWarning: `option.maxLocations` has to be larger than `option.syncThreshold`. It's recommended to be 2x larger. In any other case the location syncing might not work properly.\n\n## Custom post template\n\nWith `option.postTemplate` it is possible to specify which location properties should be posted to `option.url` or `option.syncUrl`. This can be useful to reduce the\nnumber of bytes sent \"over the \"wire\".\n\nAll wanted location properties have to be prefixed with `@`. For all available properties check [Location event](#location-event).\n\nTwo forms are supported:\n\n**jsonObject**\n\n```\nBackgroundGeolocation.configure({\n  postTemplate: {\n    lat: '@latitude',\n    lon: '@longitude',\n    foo: 'bar' // you can also add your own properties\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**jsonArray**\n```\nBackgroundGeolocation.configure({\n  postTemplate: ['@latitude', '@longitude', 'foo', 'bar']\n});\n```\n\nNote: Keep in mind that all locations (even a single one) will be sent as an array of object(s), when postTemplate is `jsonObject` and array of array(s) for `jsonArray`!\n\n### Android Headless Task (Experimental)\n\nA special task that gets executed when the app is terminated, but the plugin was configured to continue running in the background (option `stopOnTerminate: false`). In this scenario the [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html)\nwas killed by the system and all registered event listeners will not be triggered until the app is relaunched.\n\n**Note:** Prefer configuration options `url` and `syncUrl` over headless task. Use it sparingly!\n\n#### Task event\n| Parameter          | Type      | Description                                                            |\n|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `event.name`       | `String`  | Name of the event [ \"location\", \"stationary\", \"activity\" ]             |\n| `event.params`     | `Object`  | Event parameters. @see [Events](#events)                               |\n\nKeep in mind that the callback function lives in an isolated scope. Variables from a higher scope cannot be referenced!\n\nFollowing example requires [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled backend server.\n\n**Warning:** callback function must by `async`!\n\n```\nBackgroundGeolocation.headlessTask(async (event) => {\n    if (event.name === 'location' ||\n      event.name === 'stationary') {\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.open('POST', 'http://192.168.81.14:3000/headless');\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send(JSON.stringify(event.params));\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**Important:**\n\nAfter application is launched again (main activity becomes visible), it is important to call `start` method to rebind all event listeners.\n\n```\nBackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(({ isRunning }) => {\n  if (isRunning) {\n    BackgroundGeolocation.start(); // service was running -> rebind all listeners\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Transforming/filtering locations in native code\n\nIn some cases you might want to modify a location before posting, reject a location, or any other logic around incoming locations - in native code. There's an option of doing so with a headless task, but you may want to preserve battery, or do more complex actions that are not available in React.\n\nIn those cases you could register a location transform.\n\nAndroid example:\n\nWhen the `Application` is initialized (which also happens before services gets started in the background), write some code like this:\n\n```\nBackgroundGeolocationFacade.setLocationTransform(new LocationTransform() {\n    @Nullable\n    @Override\n    public BackgroundLocation transformLocationBeforeCommit(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull BackgroundLocation location) {\n    // `context` is available too if there's a need to use a value from preferences etc.\n\n    // Modify the location\n    location.setLatitude(location.getLatitude() + 0.018);\n\n    // Return modified location\n    return location;\n\n    // You could return null to reject the location,\n    // or if you did something else with the location and the library should not post or save it.\n    }\n});\n```\n\niOS example:\n\n\nIn `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` delegate method, write some code like this:\n\n```\nBackgroundGeolocationFacade.locationTransform = ^(MAURLocation * location) {\n  // Modify the location\n  location.latitude = @(location.latitude.doubleValue + 0.018);\n  \n  // Return modified location\n  return location;\n  \n  // You could return null to reject the location,\n  // or if you did something else with the location and the library should not post or save it.\n};\n```\n\n### Advanced plugin configuration\n\n#### Change Account Service Name (Android)\n\nAdd string resource \"account_name\" into \"android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml\"\n\n```\n<string name=\"account_name\">Sync Locations</string>\n\n```\n\n### Example of backend server\n\n[Background-geolocation-server](https://github.com/mauron85/background-geolocation-server) is a backend server written in nodejs with CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support.\nThere are instructions how to run it and simulate locations on Android, iOS Simulator and Genymotion.\n\n## Debugging\n\n## Submit crash log\n\nTODO\n\n## Debugging sounds\n| Event                               | *ios*                             | *android*               |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Exit stationary region              | Calendar event notification sound | dialtone beep-beep-beep |\n| Geolocation recorded                | SMS sent sound                    | tt short beep           |\n| Aggressive geolocation engaged      | SIRI listening sound              |                         |\n| Passive geolocation engaged         | SIRI stop listening sound         |                         |\n| Acquiring stationary location sound | \"tick,tick,tick\" sound            |                         |\n| Stationary location acquired sound  | \"bloom\" sound                     | long tt beep            |\n\n**NOTE:** For iOS  in addition, you must manually enable the *Audio and Airplay* background mode in *Background Capabilities* to hear these debugging sounds.\n\n\n## Geofencing\nTry using [react-native-boundary](https://github.com/eddieowens/react-native-boundary). Let's keep this plugin lightweight as much as possible.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [CHANGES.md](/CHANGES.md)\n\nSee [变更（非官方中文版）](/CHANGES_zh-Hans.md)\n"

id=\"qs-get-sdk\"></a>Get the SDK\n\nAs of version `4.19.2`, you can add Adjust SDK from [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/adjust-sdk-160890) to your app. Alternativly, you can download the latest version from our [releases page][releases].\n\n### <a id=\"qs-add-sdk\"></a>Add the SDK to your project\n\nOpen your project in the Unity Editor, go to `Assets → Import Package → Custom Package` and select the downloaded Unity package file.\n\n![][import_package]\n\n### <a id=\"qs-integrate-sdk\"></a>Integrate the SDK into your app\n\nAdd the prefab from `Assets/Adjust/Adjust.prefab` to the first scene.\n\nYou can edit the Adjust script parameters in the prefab `Inspector menu` to set up the following options:\n\n* [Start Manually](#start-manually)\n* [Event Buffering](#event-buffering)\n* [Send In Background](#background-tracking)\n* [Launch Deferred Deeplink](#deeplinking-deferred-open)\n* [App Token](#app-token)\n* [Log Level](#adjust-logging)\n* [Environment](#environment)\n\n![][adjust_editor]\n\n<a id=\"app-token\">Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your actual App Token. Follow [these steps](https://help.adjust.com/en/dashboard/apps/app-settings#view-your-app-token) to find it in the dashboard. \n\n<a id=\"environment\">Depending on whether you are building your app for testing or for production, change the `Environment` setting to either 'Sandbox' or 'Production'.\n\n**Important:** Set the value to `Sandbox` if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to `Production` before you publish the app. Set it back to `Sandbox` if you start testing again. Also, have in mind that by default Adjust dashboard is showing production traffic of your app, so in case you want to see traffic you generated while testing in sandbox mode, make sure to switch to sandbox traffic view within dashboard.\n\nWe use the environment setting to distinguish between real traffic and artificial traffic from test devices. Please make sure to keep your environment setting updated.\n\n<a id=\"start-manually\">If you don't want the Adjust SDK to start automatically with the app's `Awake` event, select `Start Manually`. With this option, you'll initialize and start the Adjust SDK from the within the code by calling the `Adjust.start` method with the `AdjustConfig` object as a parameter.\n\nYou can find an example scene with a button menu showing these options here: `Assets/Adjust/ExampleGUI/ExampleGUI.unity`. \n\nThe source for this scene is located at `Assets/Adjust/ExampleGUI/ExampleGUI.cs`.\n\n### <a id=\"qs-adjust-logging\"></a>Adjust logging\n\nYou can increase or decrease the granularity of the logs you see by changing the value of `Log Level` to one of the following:\n\n- `Verbose` - enable all logs\n- `Debug` - disable verbose logs\n- `Info` - disable debug logs (default)\n- `Warn` - disable info logs\n- `Error` - disable warning logs\n- `Assert` - disable error logs\n- `Suppress` - disable all logs\n\nIf you want to disable all of your log output when initializing the Adjust SDK manually, set the log level to suppress and use a constructor for the `AdjustConfig` object. This opens a boolean parameter where you can enter whether the suppress log level should be supported or not:\n\n```cs\nstring appToken = \"{YourAppToken}\";\nAdjustEnvironment environment = AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox;\n\nAdjustConfig config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment, true);\nconfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Suppress);\n\nAdjust.start(config);\n```\n\nIf your target is Windows-based and you want to see the compiled logs from our library in `released` mode, redirect the log output to your app while testing it in `debug` mode.\n\nCall the method `setLogDelegate` in the `AdjustConfig` instance before starting the SDK.\n\n```cs\n//...\nadjustConfig.setLogDelegate(msg => Debug.Log(msg));\n//...\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"qs-gps\"></a>Google Play Services\n\nSince August 1st 2014, apps in the Google Play Store must use the [Google Advertising ID][google_ad_id] to uniquely identify devices. To allow the Adjust SDK to use the Google Advertising ID, integrate [Google Play Services][google_play_services]. To do this, copy the `google-play-services_lib` folder (part of the Android SDK) into the `Assets/Plugins/Android` folder of your Unity project.\n\nThere are two main ways to download the Android SDK. Any tool using the `Android SDK Manager` will offer a quick link to download and install the Android SDK tools. Once installed, you can find the libraries in the `SDK_FOLDER/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/` folder.\n\n![][android_sdk_location]\n\nIf you aren't using any tools with the Android SDK Manager, download the official standalone [Android SDK][android_sdk_download]. Next, download the Andoird SDK Tools by following the instructions in the `SDK Readme.txt` README provided by Google, located in the Android SDK folder.\n\n**Update**: With the latest Android SDK version, Google has changed the structure of the Google Play Services folders inside of the root SDK folder. It now looks like this:\n\n![][android_sdk_location_new]\n\nYou can now add only the part of the Google Play Services library that the Adjust SDK needs––the basement. To do this, add the `play-services-basement-x.y.z.aar` file to your `Assets/Plugins/Android` folder. \n\nWith Google Play Services library 15.0.0, Google has moved the classes needed to get the Google advertising ID into a  `play-services-ads-identifier` package. Add this package to your app if you are using library version 15.0.0 or later. When you’re finished, please test to make sure the Adjust SDK correctly obtains the Google advertising ID; we have noticed some inconsistencies, depending upon which Unity integrated development environment (IDE) version you use. \n\n#### <a id=\"gps-adid-permission\"></a>Add permission to gather Google advertising ID\n  \nIf you are targeting Android 12 and above (API level 31), you need to add the `com.google.android.gms.AD_ID` permission to read the device's advertising ID. This is not done automatically during the [post-build process](#qs-post-build-android). Add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to enable the permission.\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID\"/>\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Google's `AdvertisingIdClient.Info` documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid).\n\n#### Testing for the Google advertising ID\n  \nTo check whether the Adjust SDK is receiving the Google advertising ID, start your app by configuring the SDK to run in `sandbox` mode and set the log level to `verbose`. After that, track a session or an event in the app and check the list of parameters recorded in the verbose logs. If you see the `gps_adid` parameter, our SDK has successfully read the Google advertising ID.\n\nIf you encounter any issues getting the Google advertising ID, please open an issue in our Github repository or contact support@adjust.com.\n\n### <a id=\"qs-android-proguard\"></a>Proguard settings\n\nIf you are using Proguard, add these lines to your Proguard file:\n\n```\n-keep class com.adjust.sdk.** { *; }\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult {\n    int SUCCESS;\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient {\n    com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info getAdvertisingIdInfo(android.content.Context);\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info {\n    java.lang.String getId();\n    boolean isLimitAdTrackingEnabled();\n}\n-keep public class com.android.installreferrer.** { *; }\n```\n\n### <a id=\"qs-install-referrer\"></a>Google Install Referrer\n\nIn order to attribute the install of an Android app, Adjust needs information about the Google install referrer. You can set up your app to get this by using the **Google Play Referrer API** or by catching the **Google Play Store intent** with a broadcast receiver. \n\nGoogle introduced the Google Play Referrer API in order to provide a more reliable and secure way than the Google Play Store intent to obtain install referrer information and to help attribution providers fight click injections. The Google Play Store intent will exist in parallel with the API temporarily, but is set to be deprecated in the future. We encourage you to support this. \n\nThe Adjust post-build process catches the Google Play Store intent; you can take a few additional steps to add support for the new Google Play Referrer API.\n\nTo add support for the Google Play Referrer API, download the [install referrer library][install-referrer-aar] from Maven repository and place the AAR file into your `Plugins/Android` folder.\n\n#### <a id=\"qs-huawei-referrer-api\"></a>Huawei Referrer API\n\nAs of v4.21.1, the Adjust SDK supports install tracking on Huawei devices with Huawei App Gallery version 10.4 and higher. No additional integration steps are needed to start using the Huawei Referrer API.\n\n### <a id=\"qs-post-build-process\"></a>Post-build process\n\nTo complete the app build process, the Adjust Unity package performs custom post-build actions to ensure the Adjust SDK can work properly inside the app. \n\nThis process is performed by the `OnPostprocessBuild` method in `AdjustEditor.cs`. Log output messages are written to the Unity IDE console output window.\n\n#### <a id=\"qs-post-build-ios\"></a>iOS post-build process\n\nTo execute the iOS post-build process properly, use Unity 5 or later and have `iOS build support` installed. The iOS post-build process makes the following changes to your generated Xcode project:\n\n- Adds the `iAd.framework` (needed for Apple Search Ads tracking)\n- Adds the `AdServices.framework` (needed for Apple Search Ads tracking)\n- Adds the `AdSupport.framework` (needed for reading IDFA)\n- Adds the `CoreTelephony.framework` (needed for reading type of network device is connected to)\n- Adds the other linker flag `-ObjC` (needed to recognize Adjust Objective-C categories during build time)\n- Enables `Objective-C exceptions`\n\nIn case you enable iOS 14+ support (`Assets/Adjust/Toggle iOS 14 Support`), iOS post-build process will add two additional frameworks to your Xcode project:\n\n- Adds the `AppTrackingTransparency.framework` (needed to ask for user's consent to be tracked and obtain status of that consent)\n- Adds the `StoreKit.framework` (needed for communication with SKAdNetwork framework)\n\n#### <a id=\"qs-post-build-android\"></a>Android post-build process\n\nThe Android post-build process makes changes to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `Assets/Plugins/Android/`. It also checks for the presence of the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the Android plugins folder. If the file is not there, it creates a copy from our compatible manifest file `AdjustAndroidManifest.xml`. If there is already an `AndroidManifest.xml` file, it makes the following changes:\n\n- Adds the `INTERNET` permission (needed for Internet connection)\n- Adds the `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` permission (needed if you are not distributing your app via the Play Store)\n- Adds the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission (needed for reading type of network device is connected to)\n- Adds the `BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE` permission (needed for the new Google install referrer API to work)\n- Adds the Adjust broadcast receiver (needed for getting install referrer information via Google Play Store intent). For more details, consult the official [Android SDK README][android]. \n\n**Note:** If you are using your own broadcast receiver to handle the `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent, you don't need to add the Adjust broadcast receiver to your manifest file. Remove it, but add the call to the Adjust broadcast receiver inside your own receiver, as described in the [Android guide][android-custom-receiver].\n\n### <a id=\"qs-sdk-signature\"></a>SDK signature\n\nAn account manager can activate the Adjust SDK signature for you. Contact Adjust support at support@adjust.com if you want to use this feature.\n\nIf the SDK signature is enabled on your account and you have access to App Secrets in your dashboard, add all secret parameters (`secretId`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `info4`) to the `setAppSecret` method of `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```cs\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", \"{YourEnvironment}\");\n\nadjustConfig.setAppSecret(secretId, info1, info2, info3, info4);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nThe SDK signature is now integrated in your app. \n\n\n## Deeplinking\n\n### <a id=\"dl\"></a>Deeplinking Overview\n\n**We support deeplinking on iOS and Android platforms.**\n\nIf you are using Adjust tracker URLs with deeplinking enabled, it is possible to receive information about the deeplink URL and its content. Users may interact with the URL regardless of whether they have your app installed on their device (standard deeplinking) or not (deferred deeplinking). \n\nWith standard deeplinking, the Android platform lets you receive deeplink content; however, Android does not automatically support deferred deeplinking. To access deferred deeplink content, you can use the Adjust SDK.\n\nSet up deeplink handling in your app on a **native level** within your generated Xcode project (for iOS) and Android Studio / Eclipse project (for Android).\n\n### <a id=\"dl-standard\"></a>Standard deeplinking\n\nInformation about standard deeplinks cannot be delivered to you in Unity C# code. Once you enable your app to handle deeplinking, you’ll get information about the deeplink on a native level. For more information, here’s how to enable deeplinking for [Android](#dl-app-android) and [iOS](#dl-app-ios) apps.\n\n### <a id=\"dl-deferred\"></a>Deferred deeplinking\n\nIn order to get content information about the deferred deeplink, set a callback method on the `AdjustConfig` object. This will receive one `string` parameter where the content of the URL is delivered. Set this method on the config object by calling the method `setDeferredDeeplinkDelegate`:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nprivate void DeferredDeeplinkCallback(string deeplinkURL) {\n   Debug.Log(\"Deeplink URL: \" + deeplinkURL);\n\n   // ...\n}\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", \"{YourEnvironment}\");\n\nadjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkDelegate(DeferredDeeplinkCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n<a id=\"deeplinking-deferred-open\"></a>With deferred deeplinking, there is an additional setting you can set on the `AdjustConfig` object. Once the Adjust SDK gets the deferred deeplink information, you can choose whether our SDK should open the URL or not. You can set this option by calling the `setLaunchDeferredDeeplink` method on the config object:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nprivate void DeferredDeeplinkCallback(string deeplinkURL) {\n   Debug.Log (\"Deeplink URL: \" + deeplinkURL);\n\n   // ...\n}\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", \"{YourEnvironment}\");\n\nadjustConfig.setLaunchDeferredDeeplink(true);\nadjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkDelegate(DeferredDeeplinkCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, **the Adjust SDK will always try to launch the URL by default**.\n\nTo enable your apps to support deeplinking, set up schemes for each supported platform.\n\n### <a id=\"dl-app-android\"></a>Deeplink handling in Android apps\n\nTo set up deeplink handling in an Android app on a native level, follow the instructions in our official [Android SDK README][android-deeplinking].\n\nThis should be done in native Android Studio / Eclipse project.\n\n### <a id=\"dl-app-ios\"></a>Deeplink handling in iOS apps\n\n**This should be done in native Xcode project.**\n\nTo set up deeplink handling in an iOS app on a nativel level, please use a native Xcode project and follow the instructions in our official [iOS SDK README][ios-deeplinking].\n\n## Event tracking\n\n### <a id=\"et-tracking\"></a>Track an event\n\nYou can use Adjust to track any event in your app. If you want to track every tap on a button, [create a new event token](https://help.adjust.com/en/tracking/in-app-events/basic-event-setup#generate-event-tokens-in-the-adjust-dashboard) in your dashboard. Let's say that the event token is `abc123`. In your button's click handler method, add the following lines to track the click:\n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"et-revenue\"></a>Track revenue\n\nIf your users generate revenue by engaging with advertisements or making in-app purchases, you can track this with events. For example: if one add tap is worth one Euro cent, you can track the revenue event like this:\n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nWhen you set a currency token, Adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues using the openexchange API into a reporting revenue of your choice. [Read more about currency conversion here](http://help.adjust.com/tracking/revenue-events/currency-conversion).\n\nIf you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call `trackEvent` only if the purchase is finished and the item has been purchased. This is important in order to avoid tracking revenue your users did not actually generate.\n\n\n### <a id=\"et-revenue-deduplication\"></a>Revenue deduplication\n\nAdd an optional transaction ID to avoid tracking duplicated revenues. The SDK remembers the last ten transaction IDs and skips revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs. This is especially useful for tracking in-app purchases. \n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\nadjustEvent.setTransactionId(\"transactionId\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n## Custom parameters\n\n### <a id=\"cp\"></a>Custom parameters overview\n\nIn addition to the data points the Adjust SDK collects by default, you can use the Adjust SDK to track and add as many custom values as you need (user IDs, product IDs, etc.) to the event or session. Custom parameters are only available as raw data and will **not** appear in your Adjust dashboard.\n\nUse [callback parameters](https://help.adjust.com/en/manage-data/export-raw-data/callbacks/best-practices-callbacks) for the values you collect for your own internal use, and partner parameters for those you share with external partners. If a value (e.g. product ID) is tracked both for internal use and external partner use, we recommend using both callback and partner parameters.\n\n### <a id=\"cp-event-parameters\"></a>Event parameters\n\n### <a id=\"cp-event-callback-parameters\"></a>Event callback parameters\n\nIf you register a callback URL for events in your [dashboard], we will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event is tracked. You can also put key-value pairs in an object and pass it to the `trackEvent` method. We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.\n\nFor example, if you've registered the URL `http://www.example.com/callback`, then you would track an event like this:\n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nIn this case we would track the event and send a request to:\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar\n```\n\nAdjust supports a variety of placeholders, for example `{idfa}` for iOS or `{gps_adid}` for Android, which can be used as parameter values.  Using this example, in the resulting callback we would replace the placeholder with the IDFA/ Google Play Services ID of the current device. Read more about [real-time callbacks](https://help.adjust.com/en/manage-data/export-raw-data/callbacks) and see our full list of [placeholders](https://partners.adjust.com/placeholders/). \n\n**Note:** We don't store any of your custom parameters. We only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, we will not read these parameters.\n\n\n### <a id=\"cp-event-partner-parameters\"></a>Event partner parameters\n\nOnce your parameters are activated in the dashboard, you can send them to your network partners. Read more about [module partners](https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners/) and their extended integration.\n\nThis works the same way as callback parameters; add them by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nYou can read more about special partners and these integrations in our [guide to special partners][special-partners].\n\n### <a id=\"cp-event-callback-id\"></a>Event callback identifier\n\nYou can add custom string identifiers to each event you want to track. We report this identifier in your event callbacks, letting you know which event was successfully tracked. Set the identifier by calling the `setCallbackId` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance:\n\n```cs\nAdjustEvent adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.setCallbackId(\"Your-Custom-Id\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"cp-session-parameters\"></a>Session parameters\n\nSession parameters are saved locally and sent with every Adjust SDK **event and session**. Whenever you add these parameters, we save them (so you don't need to add them again). Adding the same parameter twice will have no effect.\n\nIt's possible to send session parameters before the Adjust SDK has launched. Using the [SDK delay](#cp-delay-start), you can therefore retrieve additional values (for instance, an authentication token from the app's server), so that all information can be sent at once with the SDK's initialization. \n\n### <a id=\"cp-session-callback-parameters\"></a>Session callback parameters\n\nYou can save event callback parameters to be sent with every Adjust SDK session.\n\nThe session callback parameters' interface is similar to the one for event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and its value to an event, add them via a call to the `addSessionCallbackParameter` method of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```cs\nAdjust.addSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nSession callback parameters merge with event callback parameters, sending all of the information as one, but event callback parameters take precedence over session callback parameters. If you add an event callback parameter with the same key as a session callback parameter, we will show the event value.\n\nYou can remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desired key to the `removeSessionCallbackParameter` method of the `Adjust` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.removeSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nTo remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session callback parameters, you can reset them with the `resetSessionCallbackParameters` method of the `Adjust` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.resetSessionCallbackParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"cp-session-partner-parameters\"></a>Session partner parameters\n\nIn the same way that [session callback parameters](#cp-session-callback-parameters) are sent with every event or session that triggers our SDK, there are also session partner parameters.\n\nThese are transmitted to network partners for all of the integrations activated in your [dashboard].\n\nThe session partner parameters interface is similar to the event partner parameters interface, however instead of adding the key and its value to an event, add it by calling the `addSessionPartnerParameter` method of the `Adjust` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.addSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nSession partner parameters merge with event partner parameters. However, event partner parameters take precedence over session partner parameters. If you add an event partner parameter with the same key as a session partner parameter, we will show the event value.\n\nTo remove a specific session partner parameter, pass the desired key to the `removeSessionPartnerParameter` method of the `Adjust` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.removeSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nTo remove all keys and their corresponding values from the session partner parameters, reset it with the `resetSessionPartnerParameters` method of the `Adjust` instance.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.resetSessionPartnerParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"cp-delay-start\"></a>Delay start\n\nDelaying the start of the Adjust SDK gives your app time to receive any session parameters (such as unique identifiers) you may want to send on install.\n\nSet the initial delay time in seconds with the method `setDelayStart` in the `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```cs\nadjustConfig.setDelayStart(5.5);\n```\n\nIn this example, the Adjust SDK is prevented from sending the initial install session and any new event for 5.5 seconds. After 5.5 seconds (or if you call `Adjust.sendFirstPackages()` during that time), every session parameter is added to the delayed install session and events, and the Adjust SDK will work as usual.\n\nYou can delay the start time of the Adjust SDK for a maximum of 10 seconds.\n\n## Additional features\n\nOnce you integrate the Adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage of the following features:\n\n### <a id=\"ad-att-framework\"></a>AppTrackingTransparency framework\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nFor each package sent, the Adjust backend receives one of the following four (4) states of consent for access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device:\n\n- Authorized\n- Denied\n- Not Determined\n- Restricted\n\nAfter a device receives an authorization request to approve access to app-related data, which is used for user device tracking, the returned status will either be Authorized or Denied.\n\nBefore a device receives an authorization request for access to app-related data, which is used for tracking the user or device, the returned status will be Not Determined.\n\nIf authorization to use app tracking data is restricted, the returned status will be Restricted.\n\nThe SDK has a built-in mechanism to receive an updated status after a user responds to the pop-up dialog, in case you don't want to customize your displayed dialog pop-up. To conveniently and efficiently communicate the new state of consent to the backend, Adjust SDK offers a wrapper around the app tracking authorization method described in the following chapter, App-tracking authorization wrapper.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-ata-wrapper\"></a>App-tracking authorisation wrapper\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nAdjust SDK offers the possibility to use it for requesting user authorization in accessing their app-related data. Adjust SDK has a wrapper built on top of the [requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/3547037-requesttrackingauthorizationwith?language=objc) method, where you can as well define the callback method to get information about a user's choice. Also, with the use of this wrapper, as soon as a user responds to the pop-up dialog, it's then communicated back using your callback method. The SDK will also inform the backend of the user's choice. The `NSUInteger` value will be delivered via your callback method with the following meaning:\n\n- 0: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined`\n- 1: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted`\n- 2: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied`\n- 3: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`\n\nTo use this wrapper, you can call it as such:\n\n```csharp\nAdjust.requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler((status) =>\n{\n    switch (status)\n    {\n        case 0:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case\n            break;\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-ata-getter\"></a>Get current authorisation status\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nTo get the current app tracking authorization status you can call `getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus` method of `Adjust` class that will return one of the following possibilities:\n\n* `0`: The user hasn't been asked yet\n* `1`: The user device is restricted\n* `2`: The user denied access to IDFA\n* `3`: The user authorized access to IDFA\n* `-1`: The status is not available\n\n### <a id=\"ad-skadn-framework\"></a>SKAdNetwork framework\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nIf you have implemented the Adjust iOS SDK v4.23.0 or above and your app is running on iOS 14 and above, the communication with SKAdNetwork will be set on by default, although you can choose to turn it off. When set on, Adjust automatically registers for SKAdNetwork attribution when the SDK is initialized. If events are set up in the Adjust dashboard to receive conversion values, the Adjust backend sends the conversion value data to the SDK. The SDK then sets the conversion value. After Adjust receives the SKAdNetwork callback data, it is then displayed in the dashboard.\n\nIn case you don't want the Adjust SDK to automatically communicate with SKAdNetwork, you can disable that by calling the following method on configuration object:\n\n```csharp\nadjustConfig.deactivateSKAdNetworkHandling();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-skadn-update-conversion-value\"></a>Update SKAdNetwork conversion value\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nYou can use Adjust SDK wrapper method `updateConversionValue` to update SKAdNetwork conversion value for your user:\n\n```csharp\nAdjust.updateConversionValue(6);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-skadn-cv-updated-callback\"></a>Conversion value updated callback\n\nYou can register callback to get notified each time when Adjust SDK updates conversion value for the user.\n\n```cs\nusing com.adjust.sdk;\n\npublic class ExampleGUI : MonoBehaviour {\n    void OnGUI() {\n        if (GUI.Button(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), \"callback\")) {\n            AdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\n            adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\n            adjustConfig.setConversionValueUpdatedDelegate(ConversionValueUpdatedCallback);\n\n            Adjust.start(adjustConfig);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void ConversionValueUpdatedCallback(int conversionValue)\n    {\n        Debug.Log(\"Conversion value update reported!\");\n        Debug.Log(\"Conversion value: \" + conversionValue);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-push-token\"></a>Push token (uninstall tracking)\n\nPush tokens are used for Audience Builder and client callbacks; they are also required for uninstall and reinstall tracking.\n\nTo send us a push notification token, call the `setDeviceToken` method on the `Adjust` instance when you obtain your app's push notification token (or whenever its value changes):\n\n```cs\nAdjust.setDeviceToken(\"YourPushNotificationToken\");\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-attribution-callback\"></a>Attribution callback\n\nYou can set up a callback to be notified about attribution changes. We consider a variety of different sources for attribution, so we provide this information asynchronously. Make sure to consider [applicable attribution data policies][attribution_data] before sharing any of your data with third-parties. \n\nFollow these steps to add the optional callback in your application:\n\n1. Create a method with the signature of the delegate `Action<AdjustAttribution>`.\n\n2. After creating the `AdjustConfig` object, call the `adjustConfig.setAttributionChangedDelegate` with the previously created method. You can also use a lambda with the same signature.\n\n3. If instead of using the `Adjust.prefab` the `Adjust.cs` script was added to another `GameObject`, be sure to pass the name of the `GameObject` as the second parameter of `AdjustConfig.setAttributionChangedDelegate`.\n\nBecause the callback is configured using the `AdjustConfig` instance, call `adjustConfig.setAttributionChangedDelegate` before calling `Adjust.start`.\n\n```cs\nusing com.adjust.sdk;\n\npublic class ExampleGUI : MonoBehaviour {\n    void OnGUI() {\n        if (GUI.Button(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), \"callback\")) {\n            AdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\n            adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\n            adjustConfig.setAttributionChangedDelegate(this.attributionChangedDelegate);\n\n            Adjust.start(adjustConfig);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void attributionChangedDelegate(AdjustAttribution attribution) {\n        Debug.Log(\"Attribution changed\");\n\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe callback function will be called when the SDK receives final attribution data. Within the callback function you have access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:\n\n- `string trackerToken` the tracker token of the current attribution\n- `string trackerName` the tracker name of the current attribution\n- `string network` the network grouping level of the current attribution\n- `string campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current attribution\n- `string adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current attribution\n- `string creative` the creative grouping level of the current attribution\n- `string clickLabel` the click label of the current attribution\n- `string adid` the Adjust device identifier\n- `string costType` the cost type string\n- `double? costAmount` the cost amount\n- `string costCurrency` the cost currency string\n\n**Note**: The cost data - `costType`, `costAmount` & `costCurrency` are only available when configured in `AdjustConfig` by calling `setNeedsCost` method. If not configured or configured, but not being part of the attribution, these fields will have value `null`. This feature is available in SDK v4.24.0 and above.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-ad-revenue\"></a>Ad revenue tracking\n\n**Note**: This ad revenue tracking API is available only in the native SDK v4.29.0 and above.\n\nYou can track ad revenue information with Adjust SDK by invoking the following method:\n\n```objc\n// initialise with AppLovin MAX source\nAdjustAdRevenue adjustAdRevenue = new AdjustAdRevenue(\"source\");\n// set revenue and currency\nadjustAdRevenue.setRevenue(1.00, \"USD\");\n// optional parameters\nadjustAdRevenue.setAdImpressionsCount(10);\nadjustAdRevenue.setAdRevenueNetwork(\"network\");\nadjustAdRevenue.setAdRevenueUnit(\"unit\");\nadjustAdRevenue.setAdRevenuePlacement(\"placement\");\n// callback & partner parameters\nadjustAdRevenue.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustAdRevenue.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\n// track ad revenue\nAdjust.trackAdRevenue(adjustAdRevenue);\n```\n\nCurrently we support the below `source` parameter values:\n\n- `AdjustConfig.AdjustAdRevenueSourceAppLovinMAX` - representing AppLovin MAX platform.\n- `AdjustConfig.AdjustAdRevenueSourceMopub` - representing MoPub platform.\n- `AdjustConfig.AdjustAdRevenueSourceAdMob` - representing AdMob platform.\n- `AdjustConfig.AdjustAdRevenueSourceIronSource` - representing IronSource platform.\n\n**Note**: Additional documentation which explains detailed integration with every of the supported sources will be provided outside of this README. Also, in order to use this feature, additional setup is needed for your app in Adjust dashboard, so make sure to get in touch with our support team to make sure that everything is set up correctly before you start to use this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-subscriptions\"></a>Subscription tracking\n\n**Note**: This feature is only available in the SDK v4.22.0 and above.\n\nYou can track App Store and Play Store subscriptions and verify their validity with the Adjust SDK. After a subscription has been successfully purchased, make the following call to the Adjust SDK:\n\n**For App Store subscription:**\n\n```csharp\nAdjustAppStoreSubscription subscription = new AdjustAppStoreSubscription(\n    price,\n    currency,\n    transactionId,\n    receipt);\nsubscription.setTransactionDate(transactionDate);\nsubscription.setSalesRegion(salesRegion);\n\nAdjust.trackAppStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n**For Play Store subscription:**\n\n```csharp\nAdjustPlayStoreSubscription subscription = new AdjustPlayStoreSubscription(\n    price,\n    currency,\n    sku,\n    orderId,\n    signature,\n    purchaseToken);\nsubscription.setPurchaseTime(purchaseTime);\n\nAdjust.trackPlayStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\nSubscription tracking parameters for App Store subscription:\n\n- [price](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506094-price?language=objc)\n- currency (you need to pass [currencyCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1642836-currencycode?language=objc) of the [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale?language=objc) object)\n- [transactionId](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411288-transactionidentifier?language=objc)\n- receipt(you need to pass properly formatted JSON `receipt` field of your purchased object returned from Unity IAP API)\n- [transactionDate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411273-transactiondate?language=objc)\n- salesRegion (you need to pass [countryCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1643060-countrycode?language=objc) of the [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale?language=objc) object)\n\nSubscription tracking parameters for Play Store subscription:\n\n- [price](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/SkuDetails#getpriceamountmicros)\n- [currency](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/SkuDetails#getpricecurrencycode)\n- [sku](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getsku)\n- [orderId](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getorderid)\n- [signature](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getsignature)\n- [purchaseToken](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasetoken)\n- [purchaseTime](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasetime)\n\n**Note:** Subscription tracking API offered by Adjust SDK expects all parameters to be passed as `string` values. Parameters described above are the ones which API exects you to pass to subscription object prior to tracking subscription. There are various libraries which are handling in app purchases in Unity and each one of them should return information described above in some form upon successfully completed subscription purchase. You should locate where these parameters are placed in response you are getting from library you are using for in app purchases, extract those values and pass them to Adjust API as string values.\n\nJust like with event tracking, you can attach callback and partner parameters to the subscription object as well:\n\n**For App Store subscription:**\n\n```csharp\nAdjustAppStoreSubscription subscription = new AdjustAppStoreSubscription(\n    price,\n    currency,\n    transactionId,\n    receipt);\nsubscription.setTransactionDate(transactionDate);\nsubscription.setSalesRegion(salesRegion);\n\n// add callback parameters\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\n// add partner parameters\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackAppStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n**For Play Store subscription:**\n\n```csharp\nAdjustPlayStoreSubscription subscription = new AdjustPlayStoreSubscription(\n    price,\n    currency,\n    sku,\n    orderId,\n    signature,\n    purchaseToken);\nsubscription.setPurchaseTime(purchaseTime);\n\n// add callback parameters\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\n// add partner parameters\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackPlayStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-session-event-callbacks\"></a>Session and event callbacks\n\nYou can set up callbacks to notify you of successful and failed events and/or sessions.\n\nFollow these steps to add the callback function for successfully tracked events:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\nadjustConfig.setEventSuccessDelegate(EventSuccessCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n\n// ...\n\npublic void EventSuccessCallback(AdjustEventSuccess eventSuccessData) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following callback function for failed tracked events:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\nadjustConfig.setEventFailureDelegate(EventFailureCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n\n// ...\n\npublic void EventFailureCallback(AdjustEventFailure eventFailureData) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nFor successfully tracked sessions:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\nadjustConfig.setSessionSuccessDelegate(SessionSuccessCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n\n// ...\n\npublic void SessionSuccessCallback (AdjustSessionSuccess sessionSuccessData) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nFor failed tracked sessions:\n\n```cs\n// ...\n\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{Your App Token}\", AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustLogLevel.Verbose);\nadjustConfig.setSessionFailureDelegate(SessionFailureCallback);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n\n// ...\n\npublic void SessionFailureCallback (AdjustSessionFailure sessionFailureData) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nCallback functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:\n\n- `string Message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK\n- `string Timestamp` timestamp from the server\n- `string Adid` a unique device identifier provided by Adjust\n- `Dictionary<string, object> JsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server\n\nBoth event response data objects contain:\n\n- `string EventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event\n- `string CallbackId` the custom defined callback ID set on an event object\n\nBoth event and session failed objects also contain:\n\n- `bool WillRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time\n\n### <a id=\"ad-user-attribution\"></a>User attribution\n\nThis callback, like an attribution callback, is triggered whenever the attribution information changes. Access your user's current attribution information whenever you need it by calling the following method of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```cs\nAdjustAttribution attribution = Adjust.getAttribution();\n```\n\n**Note**: Current attribution information is available after our backend tracks the app install and triggers the attribution callback. It is not possible to access a user's attribution value before the SDK has been initialized and the attribution callback has been triggered.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-device-ids\"></a>Device IDs\n\nThe Adjust SDK lets you receive device identifiers.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-idfa\">iOS Advertising Identifier\n\nTo obtain the IDFA, call the function `getIdfa` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```cs\nstring idfa = Adjust.getIdfa();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-gps-adid\"></a>Google Play Services advertising identifier\n  \nThe Google Play Services Advertising Identifier (Google advertising ID) is a unique identifier for a device. Users can opt out of sharing their Google advertising ID by toggling the \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\" setting on their device. When a user has enabled this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the Google advertising ID.\n  \n> **Important**: If you are targeting Android 12 and above (API level 31), you need to add the [`com.google.android.gms.AD_ID` permission](#gps-adid-permission) to your app. If you do not add this permission, you will not be able to read the Google advertising ID even if the user has not opted out of sharing their ID.\n\nThe Google advertising ID can only be read in a background thread. If you call the method `getGoogleAdId` of the `Adjust` instance with an `Action<string>` delegate, it will work in any situation:\n\n```cs\nAdjust.getGoogleAdId((string googleAdId) => {\n    // ...\n});\n```\n\nYou will now have access to the Google advertising ID as the variable `googleAdId`.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-amazon-adid\"></a>Amazon advertising identifier\n\nIf you need to get the Amazon advertising ID, call the `getAmazonAdId` method on `Adjust` instance:\n\n```cs\nstring amazonAdId = Adjust.getAmazonAdId();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-adid\"></a>Adjust device identifier\n\nOur backend generates a unique Adjust device identifier (known as an `adid`) for every device that has your app installed. In order to get this identifier, call this method on `Adjust` instance:\n\n```cs\nString adid = Adjust.getAdid();\n```\n\nInformation about the adid is only available after our backend tracks the app install. It is not possible to access the adid value before the SDK has been initialized and the installation of your app has been successfully tracked.\n  \n### <a id=\"set-external-device-id\"></a>Set external device ID\n\n> **Note** If you want to use external device IDs, please contact your Adjust representative. They will talk you through the best approach for your use case.\n\nAn external device identifier is a custom value that you can assign to a device or user. They can help you to recognize users across sessions and platforms. They can also help you to deduplicate installs by user so that a user isn't counted as multiple new installs.\n\nYou can also use an external device ID as a custom identifier for a device. This can be useful if you use these identifiers elsewhere and want to keep continuity.\n\nCheck out our [external device identifiers article](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/external-device-identifiers) for more information.\n\n> **Note** This setting requires Adjust SDK v4.20.0 or later.\n\nTo set an external device ID, assign the identifier to the `externalDeviceId` property of your config instance. Do this before you initialize the Adjust SDK.\n\n```csharp\nAdjustConfig.setExternalDeviceId(\"{Your-External-Device-Id}\")\n```\n\n> **Important** You need to make sure this ID is **unique to the user or device** depending on your use-case. Using the same ID across different users or devices could lead to duplicated data. Talk to your Adjust representative for more information.\n\nIf you want to use the external device ID in your business analytics, you can pass it as a session callback parameter. See the section on [session callback parameters](#cp-session-parameters) for more information.\n\nYou can import existing external device IDs into Adjust. This ensures that the backend matches future data to your existing device records. If you want to do this, please contact your Adjust representative.  \n\n### <a id=\"ad-preinstalled-apps\"></a>Preinstalled apps\n\nYou can use the Adjust SDK to recognize users whose devices had your app preinstalled during manufacturing. Adjust offers two solutions: one which uses the system payload, and one which uses a default tracker. \n\nIn general, we recommend using the system payload solution. However, there are certain use cases which may require the tracker. First check the available [implementation methods](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/pre-install-tracking#Implementation_methods) and your preinstall partner’s preferred method. If you are unsure which solution to implement, reach out to integration@adjust.com\n\n#### Use the system payload\n\n- The Content Provider, System Properties, or File System method is supported from SDK v4.23.0 and above.\n\n- The System Installer Receiver method is supported from SDK v4.27.0 and above.\n\nEnable the Adjust SDK to recognise preinstalled apps by calling `setPreinstallTrackingEnabled` with the parameter `true` after creating the config object:\n\n\n```csharp\nadjustConfig.setPreinstallTrackingEnabled(true);\n```\n\nDepending upon your implmentation method, you may need to make a change to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Find the required code change using the table below.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n  <b>Method</b>\n</td>\n<td>\n  <b>AndroidManifest.xml change</b>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Content Provider</td>\n<td>Add permission:</br>\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"com.adjust.preinstall.READ_PERMISSION\"/>\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Installer Receiver</td>\n<td>Declare receiver:</br>\n\n```\n<receiver android:name=\"com.adjust.sdk.AdjustPreinstallReferrerReceiver\">\n    <intent-filter>\n        <action android:name=\"com.attribution.SYSTEM_INSTALLER_REFERRER\" />\n    </intent-filter>\n</receiver>\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n#### Use a default tracker\n\n- Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].\n- Open your app delegate and set the default tracker of your config:\n\n  ```csharp\n  adjustConfig.setDefaultTracker(\"{TrackerToken}\");\n  ```\n\n- Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step one. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker URL (including `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the six or seven-character token and not the entire URL.\n\n- Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in your LogCat:\n\n  ```\n  Default tracker: 'abc123'\n  ```\n  \n### <a id=\"ad-offline-mode\"></a>Offline mode\n\nOffline mode suspends transmission to our servers while retaining tracked data to be sent at a later point. While the Adjust SDK is in offline mode, all information is saved in a file. Please be careful not to trigger too many events in offline mode.\n\nActivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with the parameter `true`.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.setOfflineMode(true);\n```\n\nDeactivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with `false`. When you put the Adjust SDK back into online mode, all saved information is sent to our servers with the correct time information.\n\nThis setting is not remembered between sessions, meaning that the SDK is in online mode whenever it starts, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-disable-tracking\"></a>Disable tracking\n\nYou can disable Adjust SDK tracking by invoking the method `setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `false`. This setting is remembered between sessions, but it can only be activated after the first session.\n\n```cs\nAdjust.setEnabled(false);\n```\n\nYou can check if the Adjust SDK is currently active with the method `isEnabled`. It is always possible to activate the Adjust SDK by invoking `setEnabled` with the `enabled` parameter set to `true`.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-event-buffering\"></a>Event buffering\n\nIf your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some network requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```cs\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", \"{YourEnvironment}\");\n\nadjustConfig.setEventBufferingEnabled(true);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, event buffering is disabled by default.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-background-tracking\"></a>Background tracking\n\nThe default behaviour of the Adjust SDK is to pause sending network requests while the app is in the background. You can change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```csharp\nAdjustConfig adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", \"{YourEnvironment}\");\n\nadjustConfig.setSendInBackground(true);\n\nAdjust.start(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-gdpr-forget-me\"></a>GDPR right to be forgotten\n\nIn accordance with article 17 of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you can notify Adjust when a user has exercised their right to be forgotten. Calling the following method will instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to be forgotten to the Adjust backend:\n\n```cs\nAdjust.gdprForgetMe();\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will erase the user's data and the Adjust SDK will stop tracking the user. No requests from this device will be sent to Adjust in the future.\n\nPlease note that even when testing, this decision is permanent. It is not reversible.\n\n\n## <a id=\"ad-third-party-sharing\"></a>Third-party sharing for specific users\n\nYou can notify Adjust when a user disables, enables, and re-enables data sharing with third-party partners.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-disable-third-party-sharing\"></a>Disable third-party sharing for specific users\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to disable data sharing to the Adjust backend:\n\n```csharp\nAdjustThirdPartySharing adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(false);\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will block the sharing of that specific user's data to partners and the Adjust SDK will continue to work as usual.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-enable-third-party-sharing\">Enable or re-enable third-party sharing for specific users</a>\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to share data or change data sharing, to the Adjust backend:\n\n```csharp\nAdjustThirdPartySharing adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(true);\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user's data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to send the granular options to the Adjust backend:\n\n```csharp\nAdjustThirdPartySharing adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(null);\nadjustThirdPartySharing.addGranularOption(\"PartnerA\", \"foo\", \"bar\");\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ad-measurement-consent\"></a>Consent measurement for specific users\n\nYou can notify Adjust when a user exercises their right to change data sharing with partners for marketing purposes, but they allow data sharing for statistical purposes. \n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to change data sharing, to the Adjust backend:\n\n```csharp\nAdjust.trackMeasurementConsent(true);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user's data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\n\n### <a id=\"ad-data-residency\"></a>Data residency\n\nIn order to enable data residency feature, make sure to make a call to `setUrlStrategy` method of the `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following constants:\n\n```objc\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.AdjustDataResidencyEU); // for EU data residency region\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.AdjustDataResidencyTR); // for Turkey data residency region\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.AdjustDataResidencyUS); // for US data residency region\n```\n\n## Testing and troubleshooting\n\n### <a id=\"tt-debug-ios\"></a>Debug information in iOS\n\nEven with the post build script it is possible that the project is not ready to run out of the box.\n\nIf needed, disable dSYM File. In the `Project Navigator`, select the `Unity-iPhone` project. Click the `Build Settings` tab and search for `debug information`. There should be an `Debug Information Format` or `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` option. Change it from `DWARF with dSYM File` to `DWARF`.\n\n\n[dashboard]:  http://dash.adjust.com\n[adjust.com]: http://adjust.com\n\n[en-readme]:  README.md\n[zh-readme]:  doc/chinese/README.md\n[ja-readme]:  doc/japanese/README.md\n[ko-readme]:  doc/korean/README.md\n\n[sdk2sdk-mopub]:    doc/english/sdk-to-sdk/mopub.md\n\n[ios]:                     https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk\n[android]:                 https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk\n[releases]:                https://github.com/adjust/adjust_unity_sdk/releases\n[google_ad_id]:            https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html\n[ios-deeplinking]:         https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk/#deeplinking-reattribution\n[attribution_data]:        https://github.com/adjust/sdks/blob/master/doc/attribution-data.md\n[special-partners]:        https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners\n[unity-purchase-sdk]:      https://github.com/adjust/unity_purchase_sdk\n[android-deeplinking]:     https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk#deep-linking\n[google_play_services]:    http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html\n[android_sdk_download]:    https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other\n[install-referrer-aar]:    https://maven.google.com/com/android/installreferrer/installreferrer/2.2/installreferrer-2.2.aar\n[android-custom-receiver]: https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk/blob/master/doc/english/referrer.md\n\n[menu_android]:             https://raw.github.com/adjust/adjust_sdk/master/Resources/unity/v4/menu_android.png\n[adjust_editor]:            https://raw.github.com/adjust/adjust_sdk/master/Resources/unity/v4/adjust_editor.png\n[import_package]:           https://raw.github.com/adjust/adjust_sdk/master/Resources/unity/v4/import_package.png\n[android_sdk_location]:     https://raw.github.com/adjust/adjust_sdk/master/Resources/unity/v4/android_sdk_download.png\n[android_sdk_location_new]: https://raw.github.com/adjust/adjust_sdk/master/Resources/unity/v4/android_sdk_download_new.png\n\n## License\n\n### <a id=\"license\"></a>License\n\nThe file mod_pbxproj.py is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\").\nYou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nThe Adjust SDK is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2021 Adjust GmbH, http://www.adjust.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Standalone Browser Scripts\n\nEach standalone release script is available at <https://cdn.sheetjs.com/>.\n\nThe current version is `0.18.7` and can be referenced as follows:\n\n```html\n<!-- use version 0.18.7 -->\n<script lang=\"javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe `latest` tag references the latest version and updates with each release:\n\n```html\n<!-- use the latest version -->\n<script lang=\"javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**For production use, scripts should be downloaded and added to a public folder\nalongside other scripts.**\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Browser builds</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe complete single-file version is generated at `dist/xlsx.full.min.js`\n\n`dist/xlsx.core.min.js` omits codepage library (no support for XLS encodings)\n\nA slimmer build is generated at `dist/xlsx.mini.min.js`. Compared to full build:\n- codepage library skipped (no support for XLS encodings)\n- no support for XLSB / XLS / Lotus 1-2-3 / SpreadsheetML 2003 / Numbers\n- node stream utils removed\n\nThese scripts are also available on the CDN:\n\n```html\n<!-- use xlsx.mini.min.js from version 0.18.7 -->\n<script lang=\"javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/dist/xlsx.mini.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n[Bower](https://bower.io/search/?q=js-xlsx) will pull the entire repo:\n\n```bash\n$ bower install js-xlsx\n```\n\nBower will place the standalone scripts in `bower_components/js-xlsx/dist/`\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Internet Explorer and ECMAScript 3 Compatibility</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nFor broad compatibility with JavaScript engines, the library is written using\nECMAScript 3 language dialect as well as some ES5 features like `Array#forEach`.\nOlder browsers require shims to provide missing functions.\n\nTo use the shim, add the shim before the script tag that loads `xlsx.js`:\n\n```html\n<!-- add the shim first -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"shim.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- after the shim is referenced, add the library -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nDue to SSL certificate compatibility issues, it is highly recommended to save\nthe Standalone and Shim scripts from <https://cdn.sheetjs.com/> and add to a\npublic directory in the site.\n\nThe script also includes `IE_LoadFile` and `IE_SaveFile` for loading and saving\nfiles in Internet Explorer versions 6-9.  The `xlsx.extendscript.js` script\nbundles the shim in a format suitable for Photoshop and other Adobe products.\n\n</details>\n\n\n#### ECMAScript Modules\n\n_Browser ESM_\n\nThe ECMAScript Module build is saved to `xlsx.mjs` and can be directly added to\na page with a `script` tag using `type=\"module\"`:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport { read, writeFileXLSX } from \"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/xlsx.mjs\";\n\n/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */\nimport { set_cptable } from \"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/xlsx.mjs\";\nimport * as cptable from 'https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';\nset_cptable(cptable);\n</script>\n```\n\n_Frameworks (Angular, VueJS, React) and Bundlers (webpack, etc)_\n\nThe NodeJS package is readily installed from the tarballs:\n\n```bash\n$ npm  install --save https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # npm\n$ pnpm install --save https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # pnpm\n$ yarn add     --save https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # yarn\n```\n\nOnce installed, the library can be imported under the name `xlsx`:\n\n```ts\nimport { read, writeFileXLSX } from \"xlsx\";\n\n/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */\nimport { set_cptable } from \"xlsx\";\nimport * as cptable from 'xlsx/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';\nset_cptable(cptable);\n```\n\n#### Deno\n\n`xlsx.mjs` can be imported in Deno:\n\n```ts\n// @deno-types=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/types/index.d.ts\"\nimport * as XLSX from 'https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/xlsx.mjs';\n\n/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */\nimport * as cptable from 'https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';\nXLSX.set_cptable(cptable);\n```\n\n#### NodeJS\n\nTarballs are available on <https://cdn.sheetjs.com>.\n\nEach individual version can be referenced using a similar URL pattern.\n<https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz> is the URL for `0.18.7`\n\n<https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/xlsx-latest.tgz> is a link to the latest\nversion and will refresh on each release.\n\n_Installation_\n\nTarballs can be directly installed using a package manager:\n\n```bash\n$ npm  install https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # npm\n$ pnpm install https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # pnpm\n$ yarn add     https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # yarn\n```\n\nFor general stability, \"vendoring\" modules is the recommended approach:\n\n1) Download the tarball (`xlsx-0.18.7.tgz`) for the desired version. The current\n   version is available at <https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz>\n\n2) Create a `vendor` subdirectory at the root of your project and move the\n   tarball to that folder.  Add it to your project repository.\n\n3) Install the tarball using a package manager:\n\n```bash\n$ npm  install --save file:vendor/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # npm\n$ pnpm install --save file:vendor/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # pnpm\n$ yarn add            file:vendor/xlsx-0.18.7.tgz # yarn\n```\n\nThe package will be installed and accessible as `xlsx`.\n\n_Usage_\n\nBy default, the module supports `require` and it will automatically add support\nfor streams and filesystem access:\n\n```js\nvar XLSX = require(\"xlsx\");\n```\n\nThe module also ships with `xlsx.mjs` for use with `import`.  The `mjs` version\ndoes not automatically load native node modules:\n\n```js\nimport * as XLSX from 'xlsx/xlsx.mjs';\n\n/* load 'fs' for readFile and writeFile support */\nimport * as fs from 'fs';\nXLSX.set_fs(fs);\n\n/* load 'stream' for stream support */\nimport { Readable } from 'stream';\nXLSX.stream.set_readable(Readable);\n\n/* load the codepage support library for extended support with older formats  */\nimport * as cpexcel from 'xlsx/dist/cpexcel.full.mjs';\nXLSX.set_cptable(cpexcel);\n```\n\n#### Photoshop and InDesign\n\n`dist/xlsx.extendscript.js` is an ExtendScript build for Photoshop and InDesign.\n<https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.18.7/package/dist/xlsx.extendscript.js> is the\ncurrent version.  After downloading the script, it can be directly referenced\nwith a `#include` directive:\n\n```extendscript\n#include \"xlsx.extendscript.js\"\n```\n\n\n### Usage\n\nMost scenarios involving spreadsheets and data can be broken into 5 parts:\n\n1) **Acquire Data**:  Data may be stored anywhere: local or remote files,\n   databases, HTML TABLE, or even generated programmatically in the web browser.\n\n2) **Extract Data**:  For spreadsheet files, this involves parsing raw bytes to\n   read the cell data. For general JS data, this involves reshaping the data.\n\n3) **Process Data**:  From generating summary statistics to cleaning data\n   records, this step is the heart of the problem.\n\n4) **Package Data**:  This can involve making a new spreadsheet or serializing\n   with `JSON.stringify` or writing XML or simply flattening data for UI tools.\n\n5) **Release Data**:  Spreadsheet files can be uploaded to a server or written\n   locally.  Data can be presented to users in an HTML TABLE or data grid.\n\nA common problem involves generating a valid spreadsheet export from data stored\nin an HTML table.  In this example, an HTML TABLE on the page will be scraped,\na row will be added to the bottom with the date of the report, and a new file\nwill be generated and downloaded locally. `XLSX.writeFile` takes care of\npackaging the data and attempting a local download:\n\n```js\n// Acquire Data (reference to the HTML table)\nvar table_elt = document.getElementById(\"my-table-id\");\n\n// Extract Data (create a workbook object from the table)\nvar workbook = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(table_elt);\n\n// Process Data (add a new row)\nvar ws = workbook.Sheets[\"Sheet1\"];\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(ws, [[\"Created \"+new Date().toISOString()]], {origin:-1});\n\n// Package and Release Data (`writeFile` tries to write and save an XLSB file)\nXLSX.writeFile(workbook, \"Report.xlsb\");\n```\n\nThis library tries to simplify steps 2 and 4 with functions to extract useful\ndata from spreadsheet files (`read` / `readFile`) and generate new spreadsheet\nfiles from data (`write` / `writeFile`).  Additional utility functions like\n`table_to_book` work with other common data sources like HTML tables.\n\nThis documentation and various demo projects cover a number of common scenarios\nand approaches for steps 1 and 5.\n\nUtility functions help with step 3.\n\n[\"Acquiring and Extracting Data\"](#acquiring-and-extracting-data) describes\nsolutions for common data import scenarios.\n\n[\"Packaging and Releasing Data\"](#packaging-and-releasing-data) describes\nsolutions for common data export scenarios.\n\n[\"Processing Data\"](#packaging-and-releasing-data) describes solutions for\ncommon workbook processing and manipulation scenarios.\n\n[\"Utility Functions\"](#utility-functions) details utility functions for\ntranslating JSON Arrays and other common JS structures into worksheet objects.\n\n### The Zen of SheetJS\n\n_Data processing should fit in any workflow_\n\nThe library does not impose a separate lifecycle.  It fits nicely in websites\nand apps built using any framework.  The plain JS data objects play nice with\nWeb Workers and future APIs.\n\n_JavaScript is a powerful language for data processing_\n\nThe [\"Common Spreadsheet Format\"](#common-spreadsheet-format) is a simple object\nrepresentation of the core concepts of a workbook.  The various functions in the\nlibrary provide low-level tools for working with the object.\n\nFor friendly JS processing, there are utility functions for converting parts of\na worksheet to/from an Array of Arrays.  The following example combines powerful\nJS Array methods with a network request library to download data, select the\ninformation we want and create a workbook file:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Get Data from a JSON Endpoint and Generate a Workbook</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe goal is to generate a XLSB workbook of US President names and birthdays.\n\n**Acquire Data**\n\n_Raw Data_\n\n<https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/executive.json> has the desired\ndata.  For example, John Adams:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"id\": { /* (data omitted) */ },\n  \"name\": {\n    \"first\": \"John\",          // <-- first name\n    \"last\": \"Adams\"           // <-- last name\n  },\n  \"bio\": {\n    \"birthday\": \"1735-10-19\", // <-- birthday\n    \"gender\": \"M\"\n  },\n  \"terms\": [\n    { \"type\": \"viceprez\", /* (other fields omitted) */ },\n    { \"type\": \"viceprez\", /* (other fields omitted) */ },\n    { \"type\": \"prez\", /* (other fields omitted) */ } // <-- look for \"prez\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n_Filtering for Presidents_\n\nThe dataset includes Aaron Burr, a Vice President who was never President!\n\n`Array#filter` creates a new array with the desired rows.  A President served\nat least one term with `type` set to `\"prez\"`.  To test if a particular row has\nat least one `\"prez\"` term, `Array#some` is another native JS function.  The\ncomplete filter would be:\n\n```js\nconst prez = raw_data.filter(row => row.terms.some(term => term.type === \"prez\"));\n```\n\n_Lining up the data_\n\nFor this example, the name will be the first name combined with the last name\n(`row.name.first + \" \" + row.name.last`) and the birthday will be the subfield\n`row.bio.birthday`.  Using `Array#map`, the dataset can be massaged in one call:\n\n```js\nconst rows = prez.map(row => ({\n  name: row.name.first + \" \" + row.name.last,\n  birthday: row.bio.birthday\n}));\n```\n\nThe result is an array of \"simple\" objects with no nesting:\n\n```js\n[\n  { name: \"George Washington\", birthday: \"1732-02-22\" },\n  { name: \"John Adams\", birthday: \"1735-10-19\" },\n  // ... one row per President\n]\n```\n\n**Extract Data**\n\nWith the cleaned dataset, `XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet` generates a worksheet:\n\n```js\nconst worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(rows);\n```\n\n`XLSX.utils.book_new` creates a new workbook and `XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet`\nappends a worksheet to the workbook. The new worksheet will be called \"Dates\":\n\n```js\nconst workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, \"Dates\");\n```\n\n**Process Data**\n\n_Fixing headers_\n\nBy default, `json_to_sheet` creates a worksheet with a header row. In this case,\nthe headers come from the JS object keys: \"name\" and \"birthday\".\n\nThe headers are in cells A1 and B1.  `XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa` can write text\nvalues to the existing worksheet starting at cell A1:\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [[\"Name\", \"Birthday\"]], { origin: \"A1\" });\n```\n\n_Fixing Column Widths_\n\nSome of the names are longer than the default column width.  Column widths are\nset by [setting the `\"!cols\"` worksheet property](#row-and-column-properties).\n\nThe following line sets the width of column A to approximately 10 characters:\n\n```js\nworksheet[\"!cols\"] = [ { wch: 10 } ]; // set column A width to 10 characters\n```\n\nOne `Array#reduce` call over `rows` can calculate the maximum width:\n\n```js\nconst max_width = rows.reduce((w, r) => Math.max(w, r.name.length), 10);\nworksheet[\"!cols\"] = [ { wch: max_width } ];\n```\n\nNote: If the starting point was a file or HTML table, `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json`\nwill generate an array of JS objects.\n\n**Package and Release Data**\n\n`XLSX.writeFile` creates a spreadsheet file and tries to write it to the system.\nIn the browser, it will try to prompt the user to download the file.  In NodeJS,\nit will write to the local directory.\n\n```js\nXLSX.writeFile(workbook, \"Presidents.xlsx\");\n```\n\n**Complete Example**\n\n```js\n// Uncomment the next line for use in NodeJS:\n// const XLSX = require(\"xlsx\"), axios = require(\"axios\");\n\n(async() => {\n  /* fetch JSON data and parse */\n  const url = \"https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/executive.json\";\n  const raw_data = (await axios(url, {responseType: \"json\"})).data;\n\n  /* filter for the Presidents */\n  const prez = raw_data.filter(row => row.terms.some(term => term.type === \"prez\"));\n\n  /* flatten objects */\n  const rows = prez.map(row => ({\n    name: row.name.first + \" \" + row.name.last,\n    birthday: row.bio.birthday\n  }));\n\n  /* generate worksheet and workbook */\n  const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(rows);\n  const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();\n  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, \"Dates\");\n\n  /* fix headers */\n  XLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [[\"Name\", \"Birthday\"]], { origin: \"A1\" });\n\n  /* calculate column width */\n  const max_width = rows.reduce((w, r) => Math.max(w, r.name.length), 10);\n  worksheet[\"!cols\"] = [ { wch: max_width } ];\n\n  /* create an XLSX file and try to save to Presidents.xlsx */\n  XLSX.writeFile(workbook, \"Presidents.xlsx\");\n})();\n```\n\nFor use in the web browser, assuming the snippet is saved to `snippet.js`,\nscript tags should be used to include the `axios` and `xlsx` standalone builds:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"snippet.js\"></script>\n```\n\n\n</details>\n\n_File formats are implementation details_\n\nThe parser covers a wide gamut of common spreadsheet file formats to ensure that\n\"HTML-saved-as-XLS\" files work as well as actual XLS or XLSX files.\n\nThe writer supports a number of common output formats for broad compatibility\nwith the data ecosystem.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, data processing code should not have to worry\nabout the specific file formats involved.\n\n\n### JS Ecosystem Demos\n\nThe [`demos` directory](demos/) includes sample projects for:\n\n**Frameworks and APIs**\n- [`angularjs`](demos/angular/)\n- [`angular and ionic`](demos/angular2/)\n- [`knockout`](demos/knockout/)\n- [`meteor`](demos/meteor/)\n- [`react, react-native, next`](demos/react/)\n- [`vue 2.x, weex, nuxt`](demos/vue/)\n- [`XMLHttpRequest and fetch`](demos/xhr/)\n- [`nodejs server`](demos/server/)\n- [`databases and key/value stores`](demos/database/)\n- [`typed arrays and math`](demos/array/)\n\n**Bundlers and Tooling**\n- [`browserify`](demos/browserify/)\n- [`fusebox`](demos/fusebox/)\n- [`parcel`](demos/parcel/)\n- [`requirejs`](demos/requirejs/)\n- [`rollup`](demos/rollup/)\n- [`systemjs`](demos/systemjs/)\n- [`typescript`](demos/typescript/)\n- [`webpack 2.x`](demos/webpack/)\n\n**Platforms and Integrations**\n- [`deno`](demos/deno/)\n- [`electron application`](demos/electron/)\n- [`nw.js application`](demos/nwjs/)\n- [`Chrome / Chromium extensions`](demos/chrome/)\n- [`Download a Google Sheet locally`](demos/google-sheet/)\n- [`Adobe ExtendScript`](demos/extendscript/)\n- [`Headless Browsers`](demos/headless/)\n- [`canvas-datagrid`](demos/datagrid/)\n- [`x-spreadsheet`](demos/xspreadsheet/)\n- [`react-data-grid`](demos/react/modify/)\n- [`vue3-table-light`](demos/vue/modify/)\n- [`Swift JSC and other engines`](demos/altjs/)\n- [`\"serverless\" functions`](demos/function/)\n- [`internet explorer`](demos/oldie/)\n\nOther examples are included in the [showcase](demos/showcase/).\n\n<https://sheetjs.com/demos/modify.html> shows a complete example of reading,\nmodifying, and writing files.\n\n<https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/HEAD/bin/xlsx.njs> is the command-line\ntool included with node installations, reading spreadsheet files and exporting\nthe contents in various formats.\n## Acquiring and Extracting Data\n\n### Parsing Workbooks\n\n**API**\n\n_Extract data from spreadsheet bytes_\n\n```js\nvar workbook = XLSX.read(data, opts);\n```\n\nThe `read` method can extract data from spreadsheet bytes stored in a JS string,\n\"binary string\", NodeJS buffer or typed array (`Uint8Array` or `ArrayBuffer`).\n\n\n_Read spreadsheet bytes from a local file and extract data_\n\n```js\nvar workbook = XLSX.readFile(filename, opts);\n```\n\nThe `readFile` method attempts to read a spreadsheet file at the supplied path.\nBrowsers generally do not allow reading files in this way (it is deemed a\nsecurity risk), and attempts to read files in this way will throw an error.\n\nThe second `opts` argument is optional.

The utility functions work\nwith the object representation and are intended to handle common use cases.\n\n### Modifying Workbook Structure\n\n**API**\n\n_Append a Worksheet to a Workbook_\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, sheet_name);\n```\n\nThe `book_append_sheet` utility function appends a worksheet to the workbook.\nThe third argument specifies the desired worksheet name. Multiple worksheets can\nbe added to a workbook by calling the function multiple times.  If the worksheet\nname is already used in the workbook, it will throw an error.\n\n_Append a Worksheet to a Workbook and find a unique name_\n\n```js\nvar new_name = XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, name, true);\n```\n\nIf the fourth argument is `true`, the function will start with the specified\nworksheet name.  If the sheet name exists in the workbook, a new worksheet name\nwill be chosen by finding the name stem and incrementing the counter:\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetA, \"Sheet2\", true); // Sheet2\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetB, \"Sheet2\", true); // Sheet3\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetC, \"Sheet2\", true); // Sheet4\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, sheetD, \"Sheet2\", true); // Sheet5\n```\n\n_List the Worksheet names in tab order_\n\n```js\nvar wsnames = workbook.SheetNames;\n```\n\nThe `SheetNames` property of the workbook object is a list of the worksheet\nnames in \"tab order\".  API functions will look at this array.\n\n_Replace a Worksheet in place_\n\n```js\nworkbook.Sheets[sheet_name] = new_worksheet;\n```\n\nThe `Sheets` property of the workbook object is an object whose keys are names\nand whose values are worksheet objects.  By reassigning to a property of the\n`Sheets` object, the worksheet object can be changed without disrupting the\nrest of the worksheet structure.\n\n**Examples**\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Add a new worksheet to a workbook</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThis example uses [`XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet`](#array-of-arrays-input).\n\n```js\nvar ws_name = \"SheetJS\";\n\n/* Create worksheet */\nvar ws_data = [\n  [ \"S\", \"h\", \"e\", \"e\", \"t\", \"J\", \"S\" ],\n  [  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ]\n];\nvar ws = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet(ws_data);\n\n/* Add the worksheet to the workbook */\nXLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(wb, ws, ws_name);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Modifying Cell Values\n\n**API**\n\n_Modify a single cell value in a worksheet_\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [[new_value]], { origin: address });\n```\n\n_Modify multiple cell values in a worksheet_\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, aoa, opts);\n```\n\nThe `sheet_add_aoa` utility function modifies cell values in a worksheet.  The\nfirst argument is the worksheet object.  The second argument is an array of\narrays of values.  The `origin` key of the third argument controls where cells\nwill be written.  The following snippet sets `B3=1` and `E5=\"abc\"`:\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [\n  [1],                             // <-- Write 1 to cell B3\n  ,                                // <-- Do nothing in row 4\n  [/*B5*/, /*C5*/, /*D5*/, \"abc\"]  // <-- Write \"abc\" to cell E5\n], { origin: \"B3\" });\n```\n\n[\"Array of Arrays Input\"](#array-of-arrays-input) describes the function and the\noptional `opts` argument in more detail.\n\n**Examples**\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Appending rows to a worksheet</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe special origin value `-1` instructs `sheet_add_aoa` to start in column A of\nthe row after the last row in the range, appending the data:\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_add_aoa(worksheet, [\n  [\"first row after data\", 1],\n  [\"second row after data\", 2]\n], { origin: -1 });\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Modifying Other Worksheet / Workbook / Cell Properties\n\nThe [\"Common Spreadsheet Format\"](#common-spreadsheet-format) section describes\nthe object structures in greater detail.\n\n## Packaging and Releasing Data\n\n### Writing Workbooks\n\n**API**\n\n_Generate spreadsheet bytes (file) from data_\n\n```js\nvar data = XLSX.write(workbook, opts);\n```\n\nThe `write` method attempts to package data from the workbook into a file in\nmemory.  By default, XLSX files are generated, but that can be controlled with\nthe `bookType` property of the `opts` argument.  Based on the `type` option,\nthe data can be stored as a \"binary string\", JS string, `Uint8Array` or Buffer.\n\nThe second `opts` argument is required.  [\"Writing Options\"](#writing-options)\ncovers the supported properties and behaviors.\n\n_Generate and attempt to save file_\n\n```js\nXLSX.writeFile(workbook, filename, opts);\n```\n\nThe `writeFile` method packages the data and attempts to save the new file.  The\nexport file format is determined by the extension of `filename` (`SheetJS.xlsx`\nsignals XLSX export, `SheetJS.xlsb` signals XLSB export, etc).\n\nThe `writeFile` method uses platform-specific APIs to initiate the file save. In\nNodeJS, `fs.readFileSync` can create a file.  In the web browser, a download is\nattempted using the HTML5 `download` attribute, with fallbacks for IE.\n\n_Generate and attempt to save an XLSX file_\n\n```js\nXLSX.writeFileXLSX(workbook, filename, opts);\n```\n\nThe `writeFile` method embeds a number of different export functions.  This is\ngreat for developer experience but not amenable to tree shaking using the\ncurrent developer tools.  When only XLSX exports are needed, this method avoids\nreferencing the other export functions.\n\nThe second `opts` argument is optional.

Instead, `fs.writeFileSync`\nshould be used to write the file data to a `Buffer` for use with `XLSX.write`:\n\n```js\nimport { writeFileSync } from \"fs\";\nimport { write } from \"xlsx/xlsx.mjs\";\n\nconst buf = write(workbook, {type: \"buffer\", bookType: \"xlsb\"});\n/* buf is a Buffer */\nconst workbook = writeFileSync(\"out.xlsb\", buf);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Local file in a Deno application</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n`writeFile` uses `Deno.writeFileSync` under the hood:\n\n```js\n// @deno-types=\"https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/types/index.d.ts\"\nimport * as XLSX from 'https://deno.land/x/sheetjs/xlsx.mjs'\n\nXLSX.writeFile(workbook, \"test.xlsx\");\n```\n\nApplications writing files must be invoked with the `--allow-write` flag.

The first row, if it contains\nheader labels, should be removed with a slice:\n\n```js\nconst XLSX = require(\"xlsx\");\nconst tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');\n\n/* array of arrays of the data starting on the second row */\nconst aoa = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet, {header: 1}).slice(1);\n/* dataset in the \"correct orientation\" */\nconst tf_dataset = tf.tensor2d(aoa).transpose();\n/* pull out each dataset with a slice */\nconst tf_field0 = tf_dataset.slice([0,0], [1,tensor.shape[1]]).flatten();\nconst tf_field1 = tf_dataset.slice([1,0], [1,tensor.shape[1]]).flatten();\n```\n\nThe [`array` demo](demos/array/) shows a complete example.\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Generating HTML Tables\n\n**API**\n\n_Generate HTML Table from Worksheet_\n\n```js\nvar html = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);\n```\n\nThe `sheet_to_html` utility function generates HTML code based on the worksheet\ndata.  Each cell in the worksheet is mapped to a `<TD>` element.  Merged cells\nin the worksheet are serialized by setting `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes.\n\n**Examples**\n\nThe `sheet_to_html` utility function generates HTML code that can be added to\nany DOM element by setting the `innerHTML`:\n\n```js\nvar container = document.getElementById(\"tavolo\");\ncontainer.innerHTML = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);\n```\n\nCombining with `fetch`, constructing a site from a workbook is straightforward:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Vanilla JS + HTML fetch workbook and generate table previews</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <style>TABLE { border-collapse: collapse; } TD { border: 1px solid; }</style>\n  <div id=\"tavolo\"></div>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-latest/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n(async() => {\n  /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */\n  const workbook = XLSX.read(await (await fetch(\"sheetjs.xlsx\")).arrayBuffer());\n\n  let output = [];\n  /* loop through the worksheet names in order */\n  workbook.SheetNames.forEach(name => {\n\n    /* generate HTML from the corresponding worksheets */\n    const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[name];\n    const html = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(worksheet);\n\n    /* add a header with the title name followed by the table */\n    output.push(`<H3>${name}</H3>${html}`);\n  });\n  /* write to the DOM at the end */\n  tavolo.innerHTML = output.join(\"\\n\");\n})();\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>React fetch workbook and generate HTML table previews</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nIt is generally recommended to use a React-friendly workflow, but it is possible\nto generate HTML and use it in React with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Tabeller(props) {\n  /* the workbook object is the state */\n  const [workbook, setWorkbook] = React.useState(XLSX.utils.book_new());\n\n  /* fetch and update the workbook with an effect */\n  React.useEffect(() => { (async() => {\n    /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */\n    const wb = XLSX.read(await (await fetch(\"sheetjs.xlsx\")).arrayBuffer());\n    setWorkbook(wb);\n  })(); });\n\n  return workbook.SheetNames.map(name => (<>\n    <h3>name</h3>\n    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n      /* this __html mantra is needed to set the inner HTML */\n      __html: XLSX.utils.sheet_to_html(workbook.Sheets[name])\n    }} />\n  </>));\n}\n```\n\nThe [`react` demo](demos/react) includes more React examples.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>VueJS fetch workbook and generate HTML table previews</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nIt is generally recommended to use a VueJS-friendly workflow, but it is possible\nto generate HTML and use it in VueJS with the `v-html` directive:\n\n```jsx\nimport { read, utils } from 'xlsx';\nimport { reactive } from 'vue';\n\nconst S5SComponent = {\n  mounted() { (async() => {\n    /* fetch and parse workbook -- see the fetch example for details */\n    const workbook = read(await (await fetch(\"sheetjs.xlsx\")).arrayBuffer());\n    /* loop through the worksheet names in order */\n    workbook.SheetNames.forEach(name => {\n      /* generate HTML from the corresponding worksheets */\n      const html = utils.sheet_to_html(workbook.Sheets[name]);\n      /* add to state */\n      this.wb.wb.push({ name, html });\n    });\n  })(); },\n  /* this state mantra is required for array updates to work */\n  setup() { return { wb: reactive({ wb: [] }) }; },\n  template: `\n  <div v-for=\"ws in wb.wb\" :key=\"ws.name\">\n    <h3>{{ ws.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-html=\"ws.html\"></div>\n  </div>`\n};\n```\n\nThe [`vuejs` demo](demos/vue) includes more React examples.\n\n</details>\n\n### Generating Single-Worksheet Snapshots\n\nThe `sheet_to_*` functions accept a worksheet object.\n\n**API**\n\n_Generate a CSV from a single worksheet_\n\n```js\nvar csv = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv(worksheet, opts);\n```\n\nThis snapshot is designed to replicate the \"CSV UTF8 (`.csv`)\" output type.\n[\"Delimiter-Separated Output\"](#delimiter-separated-output) describes the\nfunction and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.\n\n_Generate \"Text\" from a single worksheet_\n\n```js\nvar txt = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_txt(worksheet, opts);\n```\n\nThis snapshot is designed to replicate the \"UTF16 Text (`.txt`)\" output type.\n[\"Delimiter-Separated Output\"](#delimiter-separated-output) describes the\nfunction and the optional `opts` argument in more detail.\n\n_Generate a list of formulae from a single worksheet_\n\n```js\nvar fmla = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_formulae(worksheet);\n```\n\nThis snapshot generates an array of entries representing the embedded formulae.\nArray formulae are rendered in the form `range=formula` while plain cells are\nrendered in the form `cell=formula or value`.  String literals are prefixed with\nan apostrophe `'`, consistent with Excel's formula bar display.\n\n[\"Formulae Output\"](#formulae-output) describes the function in more detail.\n\n## Interface\n\n`XLSX` is the exposed variable in the browser and the exported node variable\n\n`XLSX.version` is the version of the library (added by the build script).\n\n`XLSX.SSF` is an embedded version of the [format library](https://github.com/SheetJS/ssf).\n\n### Parsing functions\n\n`XLSX.read(data, read_opts)` attempts to parse `data`.\n\n`XLSX.readFile(filename, read_opts)` attempts to read `filename` and parse.\n\nParse options are described in the [Parsing Options](#parsing-options) section.\n\n### Writing functions\n\n`XLSX.write(wb, write_opts)` attempts to write the workbook `wb`\n\n`XLSX.writeFile(wb, filename, write_opts)` attempts to write `wb` to `filename`.\nIn browser-based environments, it will attempt to force a client-side download.\n\n`XLSX.writeFileAsync(filename, wb, o, cb)` attempts to write `wb` to `filename`.\nIf `o` is omitted, the writer will use the third argument as the callback.\n\n`XLSX.stream` contains a set of streaming write functions.\n\nWrite options are described in the [Writing Options](#writing-options) section.\n\n### Utilities\n\nUtilities are available in the `XLSX.utils` object and are described in the\n[Utility Functions](#utility-functions) section:\n\n**Constructing:**\n\n- `book_new` creates an empty workbook\n- `book_append_sheet` adds a worksheet to a workbook\n\n**Importing:**\n\n- `aoa_to_sheet` converts an array of arrays of JS data to a worksheet.\n- `json_to_sheet` converts an array of JS objects to a worksheet.\n- `table_to_sheet` converts a DOM TABLE element to a worksheet.\n- `sheet_add_aoa` adds an array of arrays of JS data to an existing worksheet.\n- `sheet_add_json` adds an array of JS objects to an existing worksheet.\n\n\n**Exporting:**\n\n- `sheet_to_json` converts a worksheet object to an array of JSON objects.\n- `sheet_to_csv` generates delimiter-separated-values output.\n- `sheet_to_txt` generates UTF16 formatted text.\n- `sheet_to_html` generates HTML output.\n- `sheet_to_formulae` generates a list of the formulae (with value fallbacks).\n\n\n**Cell and cell address manipulation:**\n\n- `format_cell` generates the text value for a cell (using number formats).\n- `encode_row / decode_row` converts between 0-indexed rows and 1-indexed rows.\n- `encode_col / decode_col` converts between 0-indexed columns and column names.\n- `encode_cell / decode_cell` converts cell addresses.\n- `encode_range / decode_range` converts cell ranges.\n\n## Common Spreadsheet Format\n\nSheetJS conforms to the Common Spreadsheet Format (CSF):\n\n### General Structures\n\nCell address objects are stored as `{c:C, r:R}` where `C` and `R` are 0-indexed\ncolumn and row numbers, respectively.  For example, the cell address `B5` is\nrepresented by the object `{c:1, r:4}`.\n\nCell range objects are stored as `{s:S, e:E}` where `S` is the first cell and\n`E` is the last cell in the range.  The ranges are inclusive.  For example, the\nrange `A3:B7` is represented by the object `{s:{c:0, r:2}, e:{c:1, r:6}}`.\nUtility functions perform a row-major order walk traversal of a sheet range:\n\n```js\nfor(var R = range.s.r; R <= range.e.r; ++R) {\n  for(var C = range.s.c; C <= range.e.c; ++C) {\n    var cell_address = {c:C, r:R};\n    /* if an A1-style address is needed, encode the address */\n    var cell_ref = XLSX.utils.encode_cell(cell_address);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cell Object\n\nCell objects are plain JS objects with keys and values following the convention:\n\n| Key | Description                                                            |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `v` | raw value (see Data Types section for more info)                       |\n| `w` | formatted text (if applicable)                                         |\n| `t` | type: `b` Boolean, `e` Error, `n` Number, `d` Date, `s` Text, `z` Stub |\n| `f` | cell formula encoded as an A1-style string (if applicable)             |\n| `F` | range of enclosing array if formula is array formula (if applicable)   |\n| `D` | if true, array formula is dynamic (if applicable)                      |\n| `r` | rich text encoding (if applicable)                                     |\n| `h` | HTML rendering of the rich text (if applicable)                        |\n| `c` | comments associated with the cell                                      |\n| `z` | number format string associated with the cell (if requested)           |\n| `l` | cell hyperlink object (`.Target` holds link, `.Tooltip` is tooltip)    |\n| `s` | the style/theme of the cell (if applicable)                            |\n\nBuilt-in export utilities (such as the CSV exporter) will use the `w` text if it\nis available.  To change a value, be sure to delete `cell.w` (or set it to\n`undefined`) before attempting to export.  The utilities will regenerate the `w`\ntext from the number format (`cell.z`) and the raw value if possible.\n\nThe actual array formula is stored in the `f` field of the first cell in the\narray range.  Other cells in the range will omit the `f` field.\n\n#### Data Types\n\nThe raw value is stored in the `v` value property, interpreted based on the `t`\ntype property.  This separation allows for representation of numbers as well as\nnumeric text.  There are 6 valid cell types:\n\n| Type | Description                                                           |\n| :--: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `b`  | Boolean: value interpreted as JS `boolean`                            |\n| `e`  | Error: value is a numeric code and `w` property stores common name ** |\n| `n`  | Number: value is a JS `number` **                                     |\n| `d`  | Date: value is a JS `Date` object or string to be parsed as Date **   |\n| `s`  | Text: value interpreted as JS `string` and written as text **         |\n| `z`  | Stub: blank stub cell that is ignored by data processing utilities ** |\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Error values and interpretation</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n|  Value | Error Meaning   |\n| -----: | :-------------- |\n| `0x00` | `#NULL!`        |\n| `0x07` | `#DIV/0!`       |\n| `0x0F` | `#VALUE!`       |\n| `0x17` | `#REF!`         |\n| `0x1D` | `#NAME?`        |\n| `0x24` | `#NUM!`         |\n| `0x2A` | `#N/A`          |\n| `0x2B` | `#GETTING_DATA` |\n\n</details>\n\nType `n` is the Number type. This includes all forms of data that Excel stores\nas numbers, such as dates/times and Boolean fields.  Excel exclusively uses data\nthat can be fit in an IEEE754 floating point number, just like JS Number, so the\n`v` field holds the raw number.  The `w` field holds formatted text.  Dates are\nstored as numbers by default and converted with `XLSX.SSF.parse_date_code`.\n\nType `d` is the Date type, generated only when the option `cellDates` is passed.\nSince JSON does not have a natural Date type, parsers are generally expected to\nstore ISO 8601 Date strings like you would get from `date.toISOString()`.  On\nthe other hand, writers and exporters should be able to handle date strings and\nJS Date objects.  Note that Excel disregards timezone modifiers and treats all\ndates in the local timezone.  The library does not correct for this error.\n\nType `s` is the String type.  Values are explicitly stored as text.  Excel will\ninterpret these cells as \"number stored as text\".  Generated Excel files\nautomatically suppress that class of error, but other formats may elicit errors.\n\nType `z` represents blank stub cells.  They are generated in cases where cells\nhave no assigned value but hold comments or other metadata. They are ignored by\nthe core library data processing utility functions.  By default these cells are\nnot generated; the parser `sheetStubs` option must be set to `true`.\n\n\n#### Dates\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Excel Date Code details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nBy default, Excel stores dates as numbers with a format code that specifies date\nprocessing.  For example, the date `19-Feb-17` is stored as the number `42785`\nwith a number format of `d-mmm-yy`.  The `SSF` module understands number formats\nand performs the appropriate conversion.\n\nXLSX also supports a special date type `d` where the data is an ISO 8601 date\nstring.  The formatter converts the date back to a number.\n\nThe default behavior for all parsers is to generate number cells.  Setting\n`cellDates` to true will force the generators to store dates.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Time Zones and Dates</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nExcel has no native concept of universal time.  All times are specified in the\nlocal time zone.  Excel limitations prevent specifying true absolute dates.\n\nFollowing Excel, this library treats all dates as relative to local time zone.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Epochs: 1900 and 1904</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nExcel supports two epochs (January 1 1900 and January 1 1904).\nThe workbook's epoch can be determined by examining the workbook's\n`wb.Workbook.WBProps.date1904` property:\n\n```js\n!!(((wb.Workbook||{}).WBProps||{}).date1904)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Sheet Objects\n\nEach key that does not start with `!` maps to a cell (using `A-1` notation)\n\n`sheet[address]` returns the cell object for the specified address.\n\n**Special sheet keys (accessible as `sheet[key]`, each starting with `!`):**\n\n- `sheet['!ref']`: A-1 based range representing the sheet range. Functions that\n  work with sheets should use this parameter to determine the range.  Cells that\n  are assigned outside of the range are not processed.  In particular, when\n  writing a sheet by hand, cells outside of the range are not included\n\n  Functions that handle sheets should test for the presence of `!ref` field.\n  If the `!ref` is omitted or is not a valid range, functions are free to treat\n  the sheet as empty or attempt to guess the range.  The standard utilities that\n  ship with this library treat sheets as empty (for example, the CSV output is\n  empty string).\n\n  When reading a worksheet with the `sheetRows` property set, the ref parameter\n  will use the restricted range.  The original range is set at `ws['!fullref']`\n\n- `sheet['!margins']`: Object representing the page margins.  The default values\n  follow Excel's \"normal\" preset.  Excel also has a \"wide\" and a \"narrow\" preset\n  but they are stored as raw measurements. The main properties are listed below:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Page margin details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| key      | description            | \"normal\" | \"wide\" | \"narrow\" |\n|----------|------------------------|:---------|:-------|:-------- |\n| `left`   | left margin (inches)   | `0.7`    | `1.0`  | `0.25`   |\n| `right`  | right margin (inches)  | `0.7`    | `1.0`  | `0.25`   |\n| `top`    | top margin (inches)    | `0.75`   | `1.0`  | `0.75`   |\n| `bottom` | bottom margin (inches) | `0.75`   | `1.0`  | `0.75`   |\n| `header` | header margin (inches) | `0.3`    | `0.5`  | `0.3`    |\n| `footer` | footer margin (inches) | `0.3`    | `0.5`  | `0.3`    |\n\n```js\n/* Set worksheet sheet to \"normal\" */\nws[\"!margins\"]={left:0.7, right:0.7, top:0.75,bottom:0.75,header:0.3,footer:0.3}\n/* Set worksheet sheet to \"wide\" */\nws[\"!margins\"]={left:1.0, right:1.0, top:1.0, bottom:1.0, header:0.5,footer:0.5}\n/* Set worksheet sheet to \"narrow\" */\nws[\"!margins\"]={left:0.25,right:0.25,top:0.75,bottom:0.75,header:0.3,footer:0.3}\n```\n</details>\n\n#### Worksheet Object\n\nIn addition to the base sheet keys, worksheets also add:\n\n- `ws['!cols']`: array of column properties objects.  Column widths are actually\n  stored in files in a normalized manner, measured in terms of the \"Maximum\n  Digit Width\" (the largest width of the rendered digits 0-9, in pixels).  When\n  parsed, the column objects store the pixel width in the `wpx` field, character\n  width in the `wch` field, and the maximum digit width in the `MDW` field.\n\n- `ws['!rows']`: array of row properties objects as explained later in the docs.\n  Each row object encodes properties including row height and visibility.\n\n- `ws['!merges']`: array of range objects corresponding to the merged cells in\n  the worksheet.  Plain text formats do not support merge cells.  CSV export\n  will write all cells in the merge range if they exist, so be sure that only\n  the first cell (upper-left) in the range is set.\n\n- `ws['!outline']`: configure how outlines should behave.  Options default to\n  the default settings in Excel 2019:\n\n| key       | Excel feature                                 | default |\n|:----------|:----------------------------------------------|:--------|\n| `above`   | Uncheck \"Summary rows below detail\"           | `false` |\n| `left`    | Uncheck \"Summary rows to the right of detail\" | `false` |\n\n- `ws['!protect']`: object of write sheet protection properties.  The `password`\n  key specifies the password for formats that support password-protected sheets\n  (XLSX/XLSB/XLS).  The writer uses the XOR obfuscation method.  The following\n  keys control the sheet protection -- set to `false` to enable a feature when\n  sheet is locked or set to `true` to disable a feature:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Worksheet Protection Details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| key                   | feature (true=disabled / false=enabled) | default    |\n|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------|:-----------|\n| `selectLockedCells`   | Select locked cells                     | enabled    |\n| `selectUnlockedCells` | Select unlocked cells                   | enabled    |\n| `formatCells`         | Format cells                            | disabled   |\n| `formatColumns`       | Format columns                          | disabled   |\n| `formatRows`          | Format rows                             | disabled   |\n| `insertColumns`       | Insert columns                          | disabled   |\n| `insertRows`          | Insert rows                             | disabled   |\n| `insertHyperlinks`    | Insert hyperlinks                       | disabled   |\n| `deleteColumns`       | Delete columns                          | disabled   |\n| `deleteRows`          | Delete rows                             | disabled   |\n| `sort`                | Sort                                    | disabled   |\n| `autoFilter`          | Filter                                  | disabled   |\n| `pivotTables`         | Use PivotTable reports                  | disabled   |\n| `objects`             | Edit objects                            | enabled    |\n| `scenarios`           | Edit scenarios                          | enabled    |\n</details>\n\n- `ws['!autofilter']`: AutoFilter object following the schema:\n\n```typescript\ntype AutoFilter = {\n  ref:string; // A-1 based range representing the AutoFilter table range\n}\n```\n\n#### Chartsheet Object\n\nChartsheets are represented as standard sheets.  They are distinguished with the\n`!type` property set to `\"chart\"`.\n\nThe underlying data and `!ref` refer to the cached data in the chartsheet.  The\nfirst row of the chartsheet is the underlying header.\n\n#### Macrosheet Object\n\nMacrosheets are represented as standard sheets.  They are distinguished with the\n`!type` property set to `\"macro\"`.\n\n#### Dialogsheet Object\n\nDialogsheets are represented as standard sheets. They are distinguished with the\n`!type` property set to `\"dialog\"`.\n\n### Workbook Object\n\n`workbook.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook\n\n`wb.Sheets[sheetname]` returns an object representing the worksheet.\n\n`wb.Props` is an object storing the standard properties.  `wb.Custprops` stores\ncustom properties.  Since the XLS standard properties deviate from the XLSX\nstandard, XLS parsing stores core properties in both places.\n\n`wb.Workbook` stores [workbook-level attributes](#workbook-level-attributes).\n\n#### Workbook File Properties\n\nThe various file formats use different internal names for file properties.  The\nworkbook `Props` object normalizes the names:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>File Properties</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| JS Name       | Excel Description              |\n|:--------------|:-------------------------------|\n| `Title`       | Summary tab \"Title\"            |\n| `Subject`     | Summary tab \"Subject\"          |\n| `Author`      | Summary tab \"Author\"           |\n| `Manager`     | Summary tab \"Manager\"          |\n| `Company`     | Summary tab \"Company\"          |\n| `Category`    | Summary tab \"Category\"         |\n| `Keywords`    | Summary tab \"Keywords\"         |\n| `Comments`    | Summary tab \"Comments\"         |\n| `LastAuthor`  | Statistics tab \"Last saved by\" |\n| `CreatedDate` | Statistics tab \"Created\"       |\n\n</details>\n\nFor example, to set the workbook title property:\n\n```js\nif(!wb.Props) wb.Props = {};\nwb.Props.Title = \"Insert Title Here\";\n```\n\nCustom properties are added in the workbook `Custprops` object:\n\n```js\nif(!wb.Custprops) wb.Custprops = {};\nwb.Custprops[\"Custom Property\"] = \"Custom Value\";\n```\n\nWriters will process the `Props` key of the options object:\n\n```js\n/* force the Author to be \"SheetJS\" */\nXLSX.write(wb, {Props:{Author:\"SheetJS\"}});\n```\n\n### Workbook-Level Attributes\n\n`wb.Workbook` stores workbook-level attributes.\n\n#### Defined Names\n\n`wb.Workbook.Names` is an array of defined name objects which have the keys:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Defined Name Properties</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| Key       | Description                                                      |\n|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `Sheet`   | Name scope.  Sheet Index (0 = first sheet) or `null` (Workbook)  |\n| `Name`    | Case-sensitive name.  Standard rules apply **                    |\n| `Ref`     | A1-style Reference (`\"Sheet1!$A$1:$D$20\"`)                       |\n| `Comment` | Comment (only applicable for XLS/XLSX/XLSB)                      |\n\n</details>\n\nExcel allows two sheet-scoped defined names to share the same name.  However, a\nsheet-scoped name cannot collide with a workbook-scope name.  Workbook writers\nmay not enforce this constraint.\n\n#### Workbook Views\n\n`wb.Workbook.Views` is an array of workbook view objects which have the keys:\n\n| Key             | Description                                         |\n|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| `RTL`           | If true, display right-to-left                      |\n\n#### Miscellaneous Workbook Properties\n\n`wb.Workbook.WBProps` holds other workbook properties:\n\n| Key             | Description                                         |\n|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| `CodeName`      | [VBA Project Workbook Code Name](#vba-and-macros)   |\n| `date1904`      | epoch: 0/false for 1900 system, 1/true for 1904     |\n| `filterPrivacy` | Warn or strip personally identifying info on save   |\n\n### Document Features\n\nEven for basic features like date storage, the official Excel formats store the\nsame content in different ways.  The parsers are expected to convert from the\nunderlying file format representation to the Common Spreadsheet Format.  Writers\nare expected to convert from CSF back to the underlying file format.\n\n#### Formulae\n\nThe A1-style formula string is stored in the `f` field.  Even though different\nfile formats store the formulae in different ways, the formats are translated.\nEven though some formats store formulae with a leading equal sign, CSF formulae\ndo not start with `=`.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Formulae File Format Support</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| Storage Representation | Formats                  | Read  | Write |\n|:-----------------------|:-------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|\n| A1-style strings       | XLSX                     |   ✔   |   ✔   |\n| RC-style strings       | XLML and plain text      |   ✔   |   ✔   |\n| BIFF Parsed formulae   | XLSB and all XLS formats |   ✔   |       |\n| OpenFormula formulae   | ODS/FODS/UOS             |   ✔   |   ✔   |\n| Lotus Parsed formulae  | All Lotus WK_ formats    |   ✔   |       |\n\nSince Excel prohibits named cells from colliding with names of A1 or RC style\ncell references, a (not-so-simple) regex conversion is possible.  BIFF Parsed\nformulae and Lotus Parsed formulae have to be explicitly unwound.  OpenFormula\nformulae can be converted with regular expressions.\n\nShared formulae are decompressed and each cell has the formula corresponding to\nits cell.  Writers generally do not attempt to generate shared formulae.\n</details>\n\n**Single-Cell Formulae**\n\nFor simple formulae, the `f` key of the desired cell can be set to the actual\nformula text.  This worksheet represents `A1=1`, `A2=2`, and `A3=A1+A2`:\n\n```js\nvar worksheet = {\n  \"!ref\": \"A1:A3\",\n  A1: { t:'n', v:1 },\n  A2: { t:'n', v:2 },\n  A3: { t:'n', v:3, f:'A1+A2' }\n};\n```\n\nUtilities like `aoa_to_sheet` will accept cell objects in lieu of values:\n\n```js\nvar worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([\n  [ 1 ], // A1\n  [ 2 ], // A2\n  [ {t: \"n\", v: 3, f: \"A1+A2\"} ] // A3\n]);\n```\n\nCells with formula entries but no value will be serialized in a way that Excel\nand other spreadsheet tools will recognize.  This library will not automatically\ncompute formula results!  For example, the following worksheet will include the\n`BESSELJ` function but the result will not be available in JavaScript:\n\n```js\nvar worksheet = XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet([\n  [ 3.14159, 2 ], // Row \"1\"\n  [ { t:'n', f:'BESSELJ(A1,B1)' } ] // Row \"2\" will be calculated on file open\n}\n```\n\nIf the actual results are needed in JS, [SheetJS Pro](https://sheetjs.com/pro)\noffers a formula calculator component for evaluating expressions, updating\nvalues and dependent cells, and refreshing entire workbooks.\n\n\n**Array Formulae**\n\n_Assign an array formula_\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, range, formula);\n```\n\nArray formulae are stored in the top-left cell of the array block.  All cells\nof an array formula have a `F` field corresponding to the range.  A single-cell\nformula can be distinguished from a plain formula by the presence of `F` field.\n\nFor example, setting the cell `C1` to the array formula `{=SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)}`:\n\n```js\n// API function\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, \"C1\", \"SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)\");\n\n// ... OR raw operations\nworksheet['C1'] = { t:'n', f: \"SUM(A1:A3*B1:B3)\", F:\"C1:C1\" };\n```\n\nFor a multi-cell array formula, every cell has the same array range but only the\nfirst cell specifies the formula.  Consider `D1:D3=A1:A3*B1:B3`:\n\n```js\n// API function\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, \"D1:D3\", \"A1:A3*B1:B3\");\n\n// ... OR raw operations\nworksheet['D1'] = { t:'n', F:\"D1:D3\", f:\"A1:A3*B1:B3\" };\nworksheet['D2'] = { t:'n', F:\"D1:D3\" };\nworksheet['D3'] = { t:'n', F:\"D1:D3\" };\n```\n\nUtilities and writers are expected to check for the presence of a `F` field and\nignore any possible formula element `f` in cells other than the starting cell.\nThey are not expected to perform validation of the formulae!\n\n\n**Dynamic Array Formulae**\n\n_Assign a dynamic array formula_\n\n```js\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, range, formula, true);\n```\n\nReleased in 2020, Dynamic Array Formulae are supported in the XLSX/XLSM and XLSB\nfile formats.  They are represented like normal array formulae but have special\ncell metadata indicating that the formula should be allowed to adjust the range.\n\nAn array formula can be marked as dynamic by setting the cell's `D` property to\ntrue.  The `F` range is expected but can be the set to the current cell:\n\n```js\n// API function\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, \"C1\", \"_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)\", 1);\n\n// ... OR raw operations\nworksheet['C1'] = { t: \"s\", f: \"_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)\", F:\"C1\", D: 1 }; // dynamic\n```\n\n**Localization with Function Names**\n\nSheetJS operates at the file level.  Excel stores formula expressions using the\nEnglish (United States) function names.  For non-English users, Excel uses a\nlocalized set of function names.\n\nFor example, when the computer language and region is set to French (France),\nExcel interprets `=SOMME(A1:C3)` as if `SOMME` is the `SUM` function.  However,\nin the actual file, Excel stores `SUM(A1:C3)`.\n\n**Prefixed \"Future Functions\"**\n\nFunctions introduced in newer versions of Excel are prefixed with `_xlfn.` when\nstored in files.  When writing formula expressions using these functions, the\nprefix is required for maximal compatibility:\n\n```js\n// Broadest compatibility\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, \"C1\", \"_xlfn.UNIQUE(A1:A3)\", 1);\n\n// Can cause errors in spreadsheet software\nXLSX.utils.sheet_set_array_formula(worksheet, \"C1\", \"UNIQUE(A1:A3)\", 1);\n```\n\nWhen reading a file, the `xlfn` option preserves the prefixes.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b> Functions requiring `_xlfn.` prefix</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThis list is growing with each Excel release.\n\n```\nACOT\nACOTH\nAGGREGATE\nARABIC\nBASE\nBETA.DIST\nBETA.INV\nBINOM.DIST\nBINOM.DIST.RANGE\nBINOM.INV\nBITAND\nBITLSHIFT\nBITOR\nBITRSHIFT\nBITXOR\nBYCOL\nBYROW\nCEILING.MATH\nCEILING.PRECISE\nCHISQ.DIST\nCHISQ.DIST.RT\nCHISQ.INV\nCHISQ.INV.RT\nCHISQ.TEST\nCOMBINA\nCONFIDENCE.NORM\nCONFIDENCE.T\nCOT\nCOTH\nCOVARIANCE.P\nCOVARIANCE.S\nCSC\nCSCH\nDAYS\nDECIMAL\nERF.PRECISE\nERFC.PRECISE\nEXPON.DIST\nF.DIST\nF.DIST.RT\nF.INV\nF.INV.RT\nF.TEST\nFIELDVALUE\nFILTERXML\nFLOOR.MATH\nFLOOR.PRECISE\nFORMULATEXT\nGAMMA\nGAMMA.DIST\nGAMMA.INV\nGAMMALN.PRECISE\nGAUSS\nHYPGEOM.DIST\nIFNA\nIMCOSH\nIMCOT\nIMCSC\nIMCSCH\nIMSEC\nIMSECH\nIMSINH\nIMTAN\nISFORMULA\nISOMITTED\nISOWEEKNUM\nLAMBDA\nLET\nLOGNORM.DIST\nLOGNORM.INV\nMAKEARRAY\nMAP\nMODE.MULT\nMODE.SNGL\nMUNIT\nNEGBINOM.DIST\nNORM.DIST\nNORM.INV\nNORM.S.DIST\nNORM.S.INV\nNUMBERVALUE\nPDURATION\nPERCENTILE.EXC\nPERCENTILE.INC\nPERCENTRANK.EXC\nPERCENTRANK.INC\nPERMUTATIONA\nPHI\nPOISSON.DIST\nQUARTILE.EXC\nQUARTILE.INC\nQUERYSTRING\nRANDARRAY\nRANK.AVG\nRANK.EQ\nREDUCE\nRRI\nSCAN\nSEC\nSECH\nSEQUENCE\nSHEET\nSHEETS\nSKEW.P\nSORTBY\nSTDEV.P\nSTDEV.S\nT.DIST\nT.DIST.2T\nT.DIST.RT\nT.INV\nT.INV.2T\nT.TEST\nUNICHAR\nUNICODE\nUNIQUE\nVAR.P\nVAR.S\nWEBSERVICE\nWEIBULL.DIST\nXLOOKUP\nXOR\nZ.TEST\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Row and Column Properties\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Format Support</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n**Row Properties**: XLSX/M, XLSB, BIFF8 XLS, XLML, SYLK, DOM, ODS\n\n**Column Properties**: XLSX/M, XLSB, BIFF8 XLS, XLML, SYLK, DOM\n\n</details>\n\n\nRow and Column properties are not extracted by default when reading from a file\nand are not persisted by default when writing to a file. The option\n`cellStyles: true` must be passed to the relevant read or write function.\n\n_Column Properties_\n\nThe `!cols` array in each worksheet, if present, is a collection of `ColInfo`\nobjects which have the following properties:\n\n```typescript\ntype ColInfo = {\n  /* visibility */\n  hidden?: boolean; // if true, the column is hidden\n\n  /* column width is specified in one of the following ways: */\n  wpx?:    number;  // width in screen pixels\n  width?:  number;  // width in Excel's \"Max Digit Width\", width*256 is integral\n  wch?:    number;  // width in characters\n\n  /* other fields for preserving features from files */\n  level?:  number;  // 0-indexed outline / group level\n  MDW?:    number;  // Excel's \"Max Digit Width\" unit, always integral\n};\n```\n\n_Row Properties_\n\nThe `!rows` array in each worksheet, if present, is a collection of `RowInfo`\nobjects which have the following properties:\n\n```typescript\ntype RowInfo = {\n  /* visibility */\n  hidden?: boolean; // if true, the row is hidden\n\n  /* row height is specified in one of the following ways: */\n  hpx?:    number;  // height in screen pixels\n  hpt?:    number;  // height in points\n\n  level?:  number;  // 0-indexed outline / group level\n};\n```\n\n_Outline / Group Levels Convention_\n\nThe Excel UI displays the base outline level as `1` and the max level as `8`.\nFollowing JS conventions, SheetJS uses 0-indexed outline levels wherein the base\noutline level is `0` and the max level is `7`.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Why are there three width types?</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThere are three different width types corresponding to the three different ways\nspreadsheets store column widths:\n\nSYLK and other plain text formats use raw character count. Contemporaneous tools\nlike Visicalc and Multiplan were character based.  Since the characters had the\nsame width, it sufficed to store a count.  This tradition was continued into the\nBIFF formats.\n\nSpreadsheetML (2003) tried to align with HTML by standardizing on screen pixel\ncount throughout the file.  Column widths, row heights, and other measures use\npixels.  When the pixel and character counts do not align, Excel rounds values.\n\nXLSX internally stores column widths in a nebulous \"Max Digit Width\" form.  The\nMax Digit Width is the width of the largest digit when rendered (generally the\n\"0\" character is the widest).  The internal width must be an integer multiple of\nthe the width divided by 256.  ECMA-376 describes a formula for converting\nbetween pixels and the internal width.  This represents a hybrid approach.\n\nRead functions attempt to populate all three properties.  Write functions will\ntry to cycle specified values to the desired type.  In order to avoid potential\nconflicts, manipulation should delete the other properties first.  For example,\nwhen changing the pixel width, delete the `wch` and `width` properties.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Implementation details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n_Row Heights_\n\nExcel internally stores row heights in points.  The default resolution is 72 DPI\nor 96 PPI, so the pixel and point size should agree.  For different resolutions\nthey may not agree, so the library separates the concepts.\n\nEven though all of the information is made available, writers are expected to\nfollow the priority order:\n\n1) use `hpx` pixel height if available\n2) use `hpt` point height if available\n\n_Column Widths_\n\nGiven the constraints, it is possible to determine the MDW without actually\ninspecting the font!  The parsers guess the pixel width by converting from width\nto pixels and back, repeating for all possible MDW and selecting the MDW that\nminimizes the error.  XLML actually stores the pixel width, so the guess works\nin the opposite direction.\n\nEven though all of the information is made available, writers are expected to\nfollow the priority order:\n\n1) use `width` field if available\n2) use `wpx` pixel width if available\n3) use `wch` character count if available\n\n</details>\n\n#### Number Formats\n\nThe `cell.w` formatted text for each cell is produced from `cell.v` and `cell.z`\nformat.  If the format is not specified, the Excel `General` format is used.\nThe format can either be specified as a string or as an index into the format\ntable.  Parsers are expected to populate `workbook.SSF` with the number format\ntable.  Writers are expected to serialize the table.\n\nCustom tools should ensure that the local table has each used format string\nsomewhere in the table.  Excel convention mandates that the custom formats start\nat index 164.  The following example creates a custom format from scratch:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>New worksheet with custom format</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n```js\nvar wb = {\n  SheetNames: [\"Sheet1\"],\n  Sheets: {\n    Sheet1: {\n      \"!ref\":\"A1:C1\",\n      A1: { t:\"n\", v:10000 },                    // <-- General format\n      B1: { t:\"n\", v:10000, z: \"0%\" },           // <-- Builtin format\n      C1: { t:\"n\", v:10000, z: \"\\\"T\\\"\\ #0.00\" }  // <-- Custom format\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nThe rules are slightly different from how Excel displays custom number formats.\nIn particular, literal characters must be wrapped in double quotes or preceded\nby a backslash. For more info, see the Excel documentation article\n`Create or delete a custom number format` or ECMA-376 18.8.31 (Number Formats)\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Default Number Formats</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe default formats are listed in ECMA-376 18.8.30:\n\n| ID | Format                     |\n|---:|:---------------------------|\n|  0 | `General`                  |\n|  1 | `0`                        |\n|  2 | `0.00`                     |\n|  3 | `#,##0`                    |\n|  4 | `#,##0.00`                 |\n|  9 | `0%`                       |\n| 10 | `0.00%`                    |\n| 11 | `0.00E+00`                 |\n| 12 | `# ?/?`                    |\n| 13 | `# ??/??`                  |\n| 14 | `m/d/yy` (see below)       |\n| 15 | `d-mmm-yy`                 |\n| 16 | `d-mmm`                    |\n| 17 | `mmm-yy`                   |\n| 18 | `h:mm AM/PM`               |\n| 19 | `h:mm:ss AM/PM`            |\n| 20 | `h:mm`                     |\n| 21 | `h:mm:ss`                  |\n| 22 | `m/d/yy h:mm`              |\n| 37 | `#,##0 ;(#,##0)`           |\n| 38 | `#,##0 ;[Red](#,##0)`      |\n| 39 | `#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)`      |\n| 40 | `#,##0.00;[Red](#,##0.00)` |\n| 45 | `mm:ss`                    |\n| 46 | `[h]:mm:ss`                |\n| 47 | `mmss.0`                   |\n| 48 | `##0.0E+0`                 |\n| 49 | `@`                        |\n\n</details>\n\nFormat 14 (`m/d/yy`) is localized by Excel: even though the file specifies that\nnumber format, it will be drawn differently based on system settings.  It makes\nsense when the producer and consumer of files are in the same locale, but that\nis not always the case over the Internet.  To get around this ambiguity, parse\nfunctions accept the `dateNF` option to override the interpretation of that\nspecific format string.\n\n#### Hyperlinks\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Format Support</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n**Cell Hyperlinks**: XLSX/M, XLSB, BIFF8 XLS, XLML, ODS\n\n**Tooltips**: XLSX/M, XLSB, BIFF8 XLS, XLML\n\n</details>\n\nHyperlinks are stored in the `l` key of cell objects.  The `Target` field of the\nhyperlink object is the target of the link, including the URI fragment. Tooltips\nare stored in the `Tooltip` field and are displayed when you move your mouse\nover the text.\n\nFor example, the following snippet creates a link from cell `A3` to\n<https://sheetjs.com> with the tip `\"Find us @ SheetJS.com!\"`:\n\n```js\nws['A1'].l = { Target:\"https://sheetjs.com\", Tooltip:\"Find us @ SheetJS.com!\" };\n```\n\nNote that Excel does not automatically style hyperlinks -- they will generally\nbe displayed as normal text.\n\n_Remote Links_\n\nHTTP / HTTPS links can be used directly:\n\n```js\nws['A2'].l = { Target:\"https://docs.sheetjs.com/#hyperlinks\" };\nws['A3'].l = { Target:\"http://localhost:7262/yes_localhost_works\" };\n```\n\nExcel also supports `mailto` email links with subject line:\n\n```js\nws['A4'].l = { Target:\"mailto:ignored@dev.null\" };\nws['A5'].l = { Target:\"mailto:ignored@dev.null?subject=Test Subject\" };\n```\n\n_Local Links_\n\nLinks to absolute paths should use the `file://` URI scheme:\n\n```js\nws['B1'].l = { Target:\"file:///SheetJS/t.xlsx\" }; /* Link to /SheetJS/t.xlsx */\nws['B2'].l = { Target:\"file:///c:/SheetJS.xlsx\" }; /* Link to c:\\SheetJS.xlsx */\n```\n\nLinks to relative paths can be specified without a scheme:\n\n```js\nws['B3'].l = { Target:\"SheetJS.xlsb\" }; /* Link to SheetJS.xlsb */\nws['B4'].l = { Target:\"../SheetJS.xlsm\" }; /* Link to ../SheetJS.xlsm */\n```\n\nRelative Paths have undefined behavior in the SpreadsheetML 2003 format.  Excel\n2019 will treat a `..\\` parent mark as two levels up.\n\n_Internal Links_\n\nLinks where the target is a cell or range or defined name in the same workbook\n(\"Internal Links\") are marked with a leading hash character:\n\n```js\nws['C1'].l = { Target:\"#E2\" }; /* Link to cell E2 */\nws['C2'].l = { Target:\"#Sheet2!E2\" }; /* Link to cell E2 in sheet Sheet2 */\nws['C3'].l = { Target:\"#SomeDefinedName\" }; /* Link to Defined Name */\n```\n\n#### Cell Comments\n\nCell comments are objects stored in the `c` array of cell objects.  The actual\ncontents of the comment are split into blocks based on the comment author.  The\n`a` field of each comment object is the author of the comment and the `t` field\nis the plain text representation.\n\nFor example, the following snippet appends a cell comment into cell `A1`:\n\n```js\nif(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];\nws.A1.c.push({a:\"SheetJS\", t:\"I'm a little comment, short and stout!\"});\n```\n\nNote: XLSB enforces a 54 character limit on the Author name.  Names longer than\n54 characters may cause issues with other formats.\n\nTo mark a comment as normally hidden, set the `hidden` property:\n\n```js\nif(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];\nws.A1.c.push({a:\"SheetJS\", t:\"This comment is visible\"});\n\nif(!ws.A2.c) ws.A2.c = [];\nws.A2.c.hidden = true;\nws.A2.c.push({a:\"SheetJS\", t:\"This comment will be hidden\"});\n```\n\n\n_Threaded Comments_\n\nIntroduced in Excel 365, threaded comments are plain text comment snippets with\nauthor metadata and parent references. They are supported in XLSX and XLSB.\n\nTo mark a comment as threaded, each comment part must have a true `T` property:\n\n```js\nif(!ws.A1.c) ws.A1.c = [];\nws.A1.c.push({a:\"SheetJS\", t:\"This is not threaded\"});\n\nif(!ws.A2.c) ws.A2.c = [];\nws.A2.c.hidden = true;\nws.A2.c.push({a:\"SheetJS\", t:\"This is threaded\", T: true});\nws.A2.c.push({a:\"JSSheet\", t:\"This is also threaded\", T: true});\n```\n\nThere is no Active Directory or Office 365 metadata associated with authors in a thread.\n\n#### Sheet Visibility\n\nExcel enables hiding sheets in the lower tab bar.  The sheet data is stored in\nthe file but the UI does not readily make it available.  Standard hidden sheets\nare revealed in the \"Unhide\" menu.  Excel also has \"very hidden\" sheets which\ncannot be revealed in the menu.  It is only accessible in the VB Editor!\n\nThe visibility setting is stored in the `Hidden` property of sheet props array.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>More details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\n| Value | Definition  |\n|:-----:|:------------|\n|   0   | Visible     |\n|   1   | Hidden      |\n|   2   | Very Hidden |\n\nWith <https://rawgit.com/SheetJS/test_files/HEAD/sheet_visibility.xlsx>:\n\n```js\n> wb.Workbook.Sheets.map(function(x) { return [x.name, x.Hidden] })\n[ [ 'Visible', 0 ], [ 'Hidden', 1 ], [ 'VeryHidden', 2 ] ]\n```\n\nNon-Excel formats do not support the Very Hidden state.  The best way to test\nif a sheet is visible is to check if the `Hidden` property is logical truth:\n\n```js\n> wb.Workbook.Sheets.map(function(x) { return [x.name, !x.Hidden] })\n[ [ 'Visible', true ], [ 'Hidden', false ], [ 'VeryHidden', false ] ]\n```\n</details>\n\n#### VBA and Macros\n\nVBA Macros are stored in a special data blob that is exposed in the `vbaraw`\nproperty of the workbook object when the `bookVBA` option is `true`.  They are\nsupported in `XLSM`, `XLSB`, and `BIFF8 XLS` formats.  The supported format\nwriters automatically insert the data blobs if it is present in the workbook and\nassociate with the worksheet names.\n\n<details>\n\t<summary><b>Custom Code Names</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe workbook code name is stored in `wb.Workbook.WBProps.CodeName`.  By default,\nExcel will write `ThisWorkbook` or a translated phrase like `DieseArbeitsmappe`.\nWorksheet and Chartsheet code names are in the worksheet properties object at\n`wb.Workbook.Sheets[i].CodeName`.  Macrosheets and Dialogsheets are ignored.\n\nThe readers and writers preserve the code names, but they have to be manually\nset when adding a VBA blob to a different workbook.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\t<summary><b>Macrosheets</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nOlder versions of Excel also supported a non-VBA \"macrosheet\" sheet type that\nstored automation commands.  These are exposed in objects with the `!type`\nproperty set to `\"macro\"`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\t<summary><b>Detecting macros in workbooks</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nThe `vbaraw` field will only be set if macros are present, so testing is simple:\n\n```js\nfunction wb_has_macro(wb/*:workbook*/)/*:boolean*/ {\n\tif(!!wb.vbaraw) return true;\n\tconst sheets = wb.SheetNames.map((n) => wb.Sheets[n]);\n\treturn sheets.some((ws) => !!ws && ws['!type']=='macro');\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Parsing Options\n\nThe exported `read` and `readFile` functions accept an options argument:\n\n| Option Name | Default | Description                                          |\n| :---------- | ------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |\n|`type`       |         | Input data encoding (see Input Type below)           |\n|`raw`        | false   | If true, plain text parsing will not parse values ** |\n|`codepage`   |         | If specified, use code page when appropriate **      |\n|`cellFormula`| true    | Save formulae to the .f field                        |\n|`cellHTML`   | true    | Parse rich text and save HTML to the `.h` field      |\n|`cellNF`     | false   | Save number format string to the `.z` field          |\n|`cellStyles` | false   | Save style/theme info to the `.s` field              |\n|`cellText`   | true    | Generated formatted text to the `.w` field           |\n|`cellDates`  | false   | Store dates as type `d` (default is `n`)             |\n|`dateNF`     |         | If specified, use the string for date code 14 **     |\n|`sheetStubs` | false   | Create cell objects of type `z` for stub cells       |\n|`sheetRows`  | 0       | If >0, read the first `sheetRows` rows **            |\n|`bookDeps`   | false   | If true, parse calculation chains                    |\n|`bookFiles`  | false   | If true, add raw files to book object **             |\n|`bookProps`  | false   | If true, only parse enough to get book metadata **   |\n|`bookSheets` | false   | If true, only parse enough to get the sheet names    |\n|`bookVBA`    | false   | If true, copy VBA blob to `vbaraw` field **          |\n|`password`   | \"\"      | If defined and file is encrypted, use password **    |\n|`WTF`        | false   | If true, throw errors on unexpected file features ** |\n|`sheets`     |         | If specified, only parse specified sheets **         |\n|`PRN`        | false   | If true, allow parsing of PRN files **               |\n|`xlfn`       | false   | If true, preserve `_xlfn.` prefixes in formulae **   |\n|`FS`         |         | DSV Field Separator override                         |\n\n- Even if `cellNF` is false, formatted text will be generated and saved to `.w`\n- In some cases, sheets may be parsed even if `bookSheets` is false.\n- Excel aggressively tries to interpret values from CSV and other plain text.\n  This leads to surprising behavior! The `raw` option suppresses value parsing.\n- `bookSheets` and `bookProps` combine to give both sets of information\n- `Deps` will be an empty object if `bookDeps` is false\n- `bookFiles` behavior depends on file type:\n    * `keys` array (paths in the ZIP) for ZIP-based formats\n    * `files` hash (mapping paths to objects representing the files) for ZIP\n    * `cfb` object for formats using CFB containers\n- `sheetRows-1` rows will be generated when looking at the JSON object output\n  (since the header row is counted as a row when parsing the data)\n- By default all worksheets are parsed.  `sheets` restricts based on input type:\n    * number: zero-based index of worksheet to parse (`0` is first worksheet)\n    * string: name of worksheet to parse (case insensitive)\n    * array of numbers and strings to select multiple worksheets.\n- `bookVBA` merely exposes the raw VBA CFB object.  It does not parse the data.\n  XLSM and XLSB store the VBA CFB object in `xl/vbaProject.bin`. BIFF8 XLS mixes\n  the VBA entries alongside the core Workbook entry, so the library generates a\n  new XLSB-compatible blob from the XLS CFB container.\n- `codepage` is applied to BIFF2 - BIFF5 files without `CodePage` records and to\n  CSV files without BOM in `type:\"binary\"`.  BIFF8 XLS always defaults to 1200.\n- `PRN` affects parsing of text files without a common delimiter character.\n- Currently only XOR encryption is supported.  Unsupported error will be thrown\n  for files employing other encryption methods.\n- Newer Excel functions are serialized with the `_xlfn.` prefix, hidden from the\n  user. SheetJS will strip `_xlfn.` normally. The `xlfn` option preserves them.\n- WTF is mainly for development.  By default, the parser will suppress read\n  errors on single worksheets, allowing you to read from the worksheets that do\n  parse properly. Setting `WTF:true` forces those errors to be thrown.\n\n### Input Type\n\nStrings can be interpreted in multiple ways.  The `type` parameter for `read`\ntells the library how to parse the data argument:\n\n| `type`     | expected input                                                  |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `\"base64\"` | string: Base64 encoding of the file                             |\n| `\"binary\"` | string: binary string (byte `n` is `data.charCodeAt(n)`)        |\n| `\"string\"` | string: JS string (characters interpreted as UTF8)              |\n| `\"buffer\"` | nodejs Buffer                                                   |\n| `\"array\"`  | array: array of 8-bit unsigned int (byte `n` is `data[n]`)      |\n| `\"file\"`   | string: path of file that will be read (nodejs only)            |\n\n### Guessing File Type\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Implementation Details</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nExcel and other spreadsheet tools read the first few bytes and apply other\nheuristics to determine a file type.  This enables file type punning: renaming\nfiles with the `.xls` extension will tell your computer to use Excel to open the\nfile but Excel will know how to handle it.  This library applies similar logic:\n\n| Byte 0 | Raw File Type | Spreadsheet Types                                   |\n|:-------|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| `0xD0` | CFB Container | BIFF 5/8 or protected XLSX/XLSB or WQ3/QPW or XLR   |\n| `0x09` | BIFF Stream   | BIFF 2/3/4/5                                        |\n| `0x3C` | XML/HTML      | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n| `0x50` | ZIP Archive   | XLSB or XLSX/M or ODS or UOS2 or NUMBERS or text    |\n| `0x49` | Plain Text    | SYLK or plain text                                  |\n| `0x54` | Plain Text    | DIF or plain text                                   |\n| `0xEF` | UTF8 Encoded  | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n| `0xFF` | UTF16 Encoded | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n| `0x00` | Record Stream | Lotus WK\\* or Quattro Pro or plain text             |\n| `0x7B` | Plain text    | RTF or plain text                                   |\n| `0x0A` | Plain text    | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n| `0x0D` | Plain text    | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n| `0x20` | Plain text    | SpreadsheetML / Flat ODS / UOS1 / HTML / plain text |\n\nDBF files are detected based on the first byte as well as the third and fourth\nbytes (corresponding to month and day of the file date)\n\nWorks for Windows files are detected based on the BOF record with type `0xFF`\n\nPlain text format guessing follows the priority order:\n\n| Format | Test                                                                |\n|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| XML    | `<?xml` appears in the first 1024 characters                        |\n| HTML   | starts with `<` and HTML tags appear in the first 1024 characters * |\n| XML    | starts with `<` and the first tag is valid                          |\n| RTF    | starts with `{\\rt`                                                  |\n| DSV    | starts with `/sep=.$/`, separator is the specified character        |\n| DSV    | more unquoted `|` chars than `;` `\\t`  `,` in the first 1024        |\n| DSV    | more unquoted `;` chars than `\\t` or `,` in the first 1024          |\n| TSV    | more unquoted `\\t` chars than `,` chars in the first 1024           |\n| CSV    | one of the first 1024 characters is a comma `\",\"`                   |\n| ETH    | starts with `socialcalc:version:`                                   |\n| PRN    | `PRN` option is set to true                                         |\n| CSV    | (fallback)                                                          |\n\n- HTML tags include: `html`, `table`, `head`, `meta`, `script`, `style`, `div`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Why are random text files valid?</b> (click to show)</summary>\n\nExcel is extremely aggressive in reading files.  Adding an XLS extension to any\ndisplay text file  (where the only characters are ANSI display chars) tricks\nExcel into thinking that the file is potentially a CSV or TSV file, even if it\nis only one column!  This library attempts to replicate that behavior.\n\nThe best approach is to validate the desired worksheet and ensure it has the\nexpected number of rows or columns.  Extracting the range is extremely simple:\n\n```js\nvar range = XLSX.utils.decode_range(worksheet['!ref']);\nvar ncols = range.e.c - range.s.c + 1, nrows = range.e.r - range.s.r + 1;\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Writing Options\n\nThe exported `write` and `writeFile` functions accept an options argument:\n\n| Option Name |  Default | Description                                         |\n| :---------- | -------: | :-------------------------------------------------- |\n|`type`       |          | Output data encoding (see Output Type below)        |\n|`cellDates`  |  `false` | Store dates as type `d` (default is `n`)            |\n|`bookSST`    |  `false` | Generate Shared String Table **                     |\n|`bookType`   | `\"xlsx\"` | Type of Workbook (see below for supported formats)  |\n|`sheet`      |     `\"\"` | Name of Worksheet for single-sheet formats **       |\n|`compression`|  `false` | Use ZIP compression for ZIP-based formats **        |\n|`Props`      |          | Override workbook properties when writing **        |\n|`themeXLSX`  |          | Override theme XML when writing XLSX/XLSB/XLSM **   |\n|`ignoreEC`   |   `true` | Suppress \"number as text\" errors **                 |\n|`numbers`    |          | Payload for NUMBERS export **                       |\n\n- `bookSST` is slower and more memory intensive, but has better compatibility\n  with older versions of iOS Numbers\n- The raw data is the only thing guaranteed to be saved.  Features not described\n  in this README may not be serialized.\n- `cellDates` only applies to XLSX output and is not guaranteed to work with\n  third-party readers.  Excel itself does not usually write cells with type `d`\n  so non-Excel tools may ignore the data or error in the presence of dates.\n- `Props` is an object mirroring the workbook `Props` field.  See the table from\n  the [Workbook File Properties](#workbook-file-properties) section.\n- if specified, the string from `themeXLSX` will be saved as the primary theme\n  for XLSX/XLSB/XLSM files (to `xl/theme/theme1.xml` in the ZIP)\n- Due to a bug in the program, some features like \"Text to Columns\" will crash\n  Excel on worksheets where error conditions are ignored.  The writer will mark\n  files to ignore the error by default.  Set `ignoreEC` to `false` to suppress.\n- Due to the size of the data, the NUMBERS data is not included by default. The\n  included `xlsx.zahl.js` and `xlsx.zahl.mjs` scripts include the data.\n\n### Supported Output Formats\n\nFor broad compatibility with third-party tools, this library supports many\noutput formats.  The specific file type is controlled with `bookType` option:\n\n| `bookType` | file ext | container | sheets | Description                     |\n| :--------- | -------: | :-------: | :----- |:------------------------------- |\n| `xlsx`     | `.xlsx`  |    ZIP    | multi  | Excel 2007+ XML Format          |\n| `xlsm`     | `.xlsm`  |    ZIP    | multi  | Excel 2007+ Macro XML Format    |\n| `xlsb`     | `.xlsb`  |    ZIP    | multi  | Excel 2007+ Binary Format       |\n| `biff8`    | `.xls`   |    CFB    | multi  | Excel 97-2004 Workbook Format   |\n| `biff5`    | `.xls`   |    CFB    | multi  | Excel 5.0/95 Workbook Format    |\n| `biff4`    | `.xls`   |   none    | single | Excel 4.0 Worksheet Format      |\n| `biff3`    | `.xls`   |   none    | single | Excel 3.0 Worksheet Format      |\n| `biff2`    | `.xls`   |   none    | single | Excel 2.0 Worksheet Format      |\n| `xlml`     | `.xls`   |   none    | multi  | Excel 2003-2004 (SpreadsheetML) |\n| `numbers`  |`.numbers`|    ZIP    | single | Numbers 3.0+ Spreadsheet        |\n| `ods`      | `.ods`   |    ZIP    | multi  | OpenDocument Spreadsheet        |\n| `fods`     | `.fods`  |   none    | multi  | Flat OpenDocument Spreadsheet   |\n| `wk3`      | `.wk3`   |   none    | multi  | Lotus Workbook (WK3)            |\n| `csv`      | `.csv`   |   none    | single | Comma Separated Values          |\n| `txt`      | `.txt`   |   none    | single | UTF-16 Unicode Text (TXT)       |\n| `sylk`     | `.sylk`  |   none    | single | Symbolic Link (SYLK)            |\n| `html`     | `.html`  |   none    | single | HTML Document                   |\n| `dif`      | `.dif`   |   none    | single | Data Interchange Format (DIF)   |\n| `dbf`      | `.dbf`   |   none    | single | dBASE II + VFP Extensions (DBF) |\n| `wk1`      | `.wk1`   |   none    | single | Lotus Worksheet (WK1)           |\n| `rtf`      | `.rtf`   |   none    | single | Rich Text Format (RTF)          |\n| `prn`      | `.prn`   |   none    | single | Lotus Formatted Text            |\n| `eth`      | `.eth`   |   none    | single | Ethercalc Record Format (ETH)   |\n\n- `compression` only applies to formats with ZIP containers.\n- Formats that only support a single sheet require a `sheet` option specifying\n  the worksheet.  If the string is empty, the first worksheet is used.\n- `writeFile` will automatically guess the output file format based on the file\n  extension if `bookType` is not specified.  It will choose the first format in\n  the aforementioned table that matches the extension.\n\n### Output Type\n\nThe `type` argument for `write` mirrors the `type` argument for `read`:\n\n| `type`     | output                                                          |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `\"base64\"` | string: Base64 encoding of the file                             |\n| `\"binary\"` | string: binary string (byte `n` is `data.charCodeAt(n)`)        |\n| `\"string\"` | string: JS string (characters interpreted as UTF8)              |\n| `\"buffer\"` | nodejs Buffer                                                   |\n| `\"array\"`  | ArrayBuffer, fallback array of 8-bit unsigned int               |\n| `\"file\"`   | string: path of file that will be created (nodejs only)         |\n\n- For compatibility with Excel, `csv` output will always include the UTF-8 byte\n  order mark.\n\n## Utility Functions\n\nThe `sheet_to_*` functions accept a worksheet and an optional options object.\n\nThe `*_to_sheet` functions accept a data object and an optional options object.\n\nThe examples are based on the following worksheet:\n\n```\nXXX| A | B | C | D | E | F | G |\n---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n 1 | S | h | e | e | t | J | S |\n 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n```\n\n### Array of Arrays Input\n\n`XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet` takes an array of arrays of JS values and returns a\nworksheet resembling the input data.  Numbers, Booleans and Strings are stored\nas the corresponding styles.  Dates are stored as date or numbers.  Array holes\nand explicit `undefined` values are skipped.  `null` values may be stubbed.

The XLSM format, almost\nidentical to XLSX, is used for files containing macros.\n\nThe format is standardized in ECMA-376 and later in ISO/IEC 29500.  Excel does\nnot follow the specification, and there are additional documents discussing how\nExcel deviates from the specification.\n\n- **Excel 2.0-95 (BIFF2/BIFF3/BIFF4/BIFF5)**\n\nBIFF 2/3 XLS are single-sheet streams of binary records.  Excel 4 introduced\nthe concept of a workbook (`XLW` files) but also had single-sheet `XLS` format.\nThe structure is largely similar to the Lotus 1-2-3 file formats.  BIFF5/8/12\nextended the format in various ways but largely stuck to the same record format.\n\nThere is no official specification for any of these formats.  Excel 95 can write\nfiles in these formats, so record lengths and fields were determined by writing\nin all of the supported formats and comparing files.  Excel 2016 can generate\nBIFF5 files, enabling a full suite of file tests starting from XLSX or BIFF2.\n\n- **Excel 97-2004 Binary (BIFF8)**\n\nBIFF8 exclusively uses the Compound File Binary container format, splitting some\ncontent into streams within the file.  At its core, it still uses an extended\nversion of the binary record format from older versions of BIFF.\n\nThe `MS-XLS` specification covers the basics of the file format, and other\nspecifications expand on serialization of features like properties.\n\n- **Excel 2003-2004 (SpreadsheetML)**\n\nPredating XLSX, SpreadsheetML files are simple XML files.  There is no official\nand comprehensive specification, although MS has released documentation on the\nformat.  Since Excel 2016 can generate SpreadsheetML files, mapping features is\npretty straightforward.\n\n- **Excel 2007+ Binary (XLSB, BIFF12)**\n\nIntroduced in parallel with XLSX, the XLSB format combines the BIFF architecture\nwith the content separation and ZIP container of XLSX.  For the most part nodes\nin an XLSX sub-file can be mapped to XLSB records in a corresponding sub-file.\n\nThe `MS-XLSB` specification covers the basics of the file format, and other\nspecifications expand on serialization of features like properties.\n\n- **Delimiter-Separated Values (CSV/TXT)**\n\nExcel CSV deviates from RFC4180 in a number of important ways.  The generated\nCSV files should generally work in Excel although they may not work in RFC4180\ncompatible readers.  The parser should generally understand Excel CSV. The\nwriter proactively generates cells for formulae if values are unavailable.\n\nExcel TXT uses tab as the delimiter and code page 1200.\n\nLike in Excel, files starting with `0x49 0x44 (\"ID\")` are treated as Symbolic\nLink files.  Unlike Excel, if the file does not have a valid SYLK header, it\nwill be proactively reinterpreted as CSV.  There are some files with semicolon\ndelimiter that align with a valid SYLK file.  For the broadest compatibility,\nall cells with the value of `ID` are automatically wrapped in double-quotes.\n\n**Miscellaneous Workbook Formats**\n\nSupport for other formats is generally far behind XLS/XLSB/XLSX support, due in\npart to a lack of publicly available documentation.  Test files were produced in\nthe respective apps and compared to their XLS exports to determine structure.\nThe main focus is data extraction.\n\n- **Lotus 1-2-3 (WKS/WK1/WK2/WK3/WK4/123)**\n\nThe Lotus formats consist of binary records similar to the BIFF structure. Lotus\ndid release a specification decades ago covering the original WK1 format.  Other\nfeatures were deduced by producing files and comparing to Excel support.\n\nGenerated WK1 worksheets are compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 R2 and Excel 5.0.\n\nGenerated WK3 workbooks are compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 R9 and Excel 5.0.\n\n- **Quattro Pro (WQ1/WQ2/WB1/WB2/WB3/QPW)**\n\nThe Quattro Pro formats use binary records in the same way as BIFF and Lotus.\nSome of the newer formats (namely WB3 and QPW) use a CFB enclosure just like\nBIFF8 XLS.\n\n- **Works for DOS / Windows Spreadsheet (WKS/XLR)**\n\nAll versions of Works were limited to a single worksheet.\n\nWorks for DOS 1.x - 3.x and Works for Windows 2.x extends the Lotus WKS format\nwith additional record types.\n\nWorks for Windows 3.x - 5.x uses the same format and WKS extension.  The BOF\nrecord has type `FF`\n\nWorks for Windows 6.x - 9.x use the XLR format.  XLR is nearly identical to\nBIFF8 XLS: it uses the CFB container with a Workbook stream.  Works 9 saves the\nexact Workbook stream for the XLR and the 97-2003 XLS export.  Works 6 XLS\nincludes two empty worksheets but the main worksheet has an identical encoding.\nXLR also includes a `WksSSWorkBook` stream similar to Lotus FM3/FMT files.\n\n- **Numbers 3.0+ / iWork 2013+ Spreadsheet (NUMBERS)**\n\niWork 2013 (Numbers 3.0 / Pages 5.0 / Keynote 6.0) switched from a proprietary\nXML-based format to the current file format based on the iWork Archive (IWA).\nThis format has been used up through the current release (Numbers 11.2).\n\nThe parser focuses on extracting raw data from tables.  Numbers technically\nsupports multiple tables in a logical worksheet, including custom titles.  This\nparser will generate one worksheet per Numbers table.\n\nThe writer currently exports a small range from the first worksheet.\n\n- **OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS/FODS)**\n\nODS is an XML-in-ZIP format akin to XLSX while FODS is an XML format akin to\nSpreadsheetML.  Both are detailed in the OASIS standard, but tools like LO/OO\nadd undocumented extensions.  The parsers and writers do not implement the full\nstandard, instead focusing on parts necessary to extract and store raw data.\n\n- **Uniform Office Spreadsheet (UOS1/2)**\n\nUOS is a very similar format, and it comes in 2 varieties corresponding to ODS\nand FODS respectively.  For the most part, the difference between the formats\nis in the names of tags and attributes.\n\n**Miscellaneous Worksheet Formats**\n\nMany older formats supported only one worksheet:\n\n- **dBASE and Visual FoxPro (DBF)**\n\nDBF is really a typed table format: each column can only hold one data type and\neach record omits type information.  The parser generates a header row and\ninserts records starting at the second row of the worksheet.  The writer makes\nfiles compatible with Visual FoxPro extensions.\n\nMulti-file extensions like external memos and tables are currently unsupported,\nlimited by the general ability to read arbitrary files in the web browser.  The\nreader understands DBF Level 7 extensions like DATETIME.\n\n- **Symbolic Link (SYLK)**\n\nThere is no real documentation.  All knowledge was gathered by saving files in\nvarious versions of Excel to deduce the meaning of fields.  Notes:\n\n- Plain formulae are stored in the RC form.\n- Column widths are rounded to integral characters.\n\n- **Lotus Formatted Text (PRN)**\n\nThere is no real documentation, and in fact Excel treats PRN as an output-only\nfile format.  Nevertheless we can guess the column widths and reverse-engineer\nthe original layout.  Excel's 240 character width limitation is not enforced.\n\n- **Data Interchange Format (DIF)**\n\nThere is no unified definition.  Visicalc DIF differs from Lotus DIF, and both\ndiffer from Excel DIF.  Where ambiguous, the parser/writer follows the expected\nbehavior from Excel.  In particular, Excel extends DIF in incompatible ways:\n\n- Since Excel automatically converts numbers-as-strings to numbers, numeric\n  string constants are converted to formulae: `\"0.3\" -> \"=\"\"0.3\"\"`\n- DIF technically expects numeric cells to hold the raw numeric data, but Excel\n  permits formatted numbers (including dates)\n- DIF technically has no support for formulae, but Excel will automatically\n  convert plain formulae.  Array formulae are not preserved.\n\n- **HTML**\n\nExcel HTML worksheets include special metadata encoded in styles.  For example,\n`mso-number-format` is a localized string containing the number format.  Despite\nthe metadata the output is valid HTML, although it does accept bare `&` symbols.\n\nThe writer adds type metadata to the TD elements via the `t` tag.  The parser\nlooks for those tags and overrides the default interpretation. For example, text\nlike `<td>12345</td>` will be parsed as numbers but `<td t=\"s\">12345</td>` will\nbe parsed as text.\n\n- **Rich Text Format (RTF)**\n\nExcel RTF worksheets are stored in clipboard when copying cells or ranges from a\nworksheet.  The supported codes are a subset of the Word RTF support.\n\n- **Ethercalc Record Format (ETH)**\n\n[Ethercalc](https://ethercalc.net/) is an open source web spreadsheet powered by\na record format reminiscent of SYLK wrapped in a MIME multi-part message.\n\n</details>\n\n\n## Testing\n\n### Node\n\n<details>\n  <summary>(click to show)</summary>\n\n`make test` will run the node-based tests.

The README is similarly split into bits in the `docbits` folder.\n\nFolders:\n\n| folder       | contents                                                      |\n|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `bits`       | raw source files that make up the final script                |\n| `docbits`    | raw markdown files that make up `README.md`                   |\n| `bin`        | server-side bin scripts (`xlsx.njs`)                          |\n| `dist`       | dist files for web browsers and nonstandard JS environments   |\n| `demos`      | demo projects for platforms like ExtendScript and Webpack     |\n| `tests`      | browser tests (run `make ctest` to rebuild)                   |\n| `types`      | typescript definitions and tests                              |\n| `misc`       | miscellaneous supporting scripts                              |\n| `test_files` | test files (pulled from the test files repository)            |\n\n</details>\n\nAfter cloning the repo, running `make help` will display a list of commands.\n\n### OSX/Linux\n\n<details>\n  <summary>(click to show)</summary>\n\nThe `xlsx.js` file is constructed from the files in the `bits` subdirectory. The\nbuild script (run `make`) will concatenate the individual bits to produce the\nscript.  Before submitting a contribution, ensure that running make will produce\nthe `xlsx.js` file exactly.  The simplest way to test is to add the script:\n\n```bash\n$ git add xlsx.js\n$ make clean\n$ make\n$ git diff xlsx.js\n```\n\nTo produce the dist files, run `make dist`.  The dist files are updated in each\nversion release and *should not be committed between versions*.\n</details>\n\n### Windows\n\n<details>\n  <summary>(click to show)</summary>\n\nThe included `make.cmd` script will build `xlsx.js` from the `bits` directory.\nBuilding is as simple as:\n\n```cmd\n> make\n```\n\nTo prepare development environment:\n\n```cmd\n> make init\n```\n\nThe full list of commands available in Windows are displayed in `make help`:\n\n```\nmake init -- install deps and global modules\nmake lint -- run eslint linter\nmake test -- run mocha test suite\nmake misc -- run smaller test suite\nmake book -- rebuild README and summary\nmake help -- display this message\n```\n\nAs explained in [Test Files](#test-files), on Windows the release ZIP file must\nbe downloaded and extracted.  If Bash on Windows is available, it is possible\nto run the OSX/Linux workflow.  The following steps prepares the environment:\n\n```bash\n# Install support programs for the build and test commands\nsudo apt-get install make git subversion mercurial\n\n# Install nodejs and NPM within the WSL\nwget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\n# Install dev dependencies\nsudo npm install -g mocha voc blanket xlsjs\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Tests\n\n<details>\n  <summary>(click to show)</summary>\n\nThe `test_misc` target (`make test_misc` on Linux/OSX / `make misc` on Windows)\nruns the targeted feature tests.  It should take 5-10 seconds to perform feature\ntests without testing against the entire test battery.  New features should be\naccompanied with tests for the relevant file formats and features.\n\nFor tests involving the read side, an appropriate feature test would involve\nreading an existing file and checking the resulting workbook object.  If a\nparameter is involved, files should be read with different values to verify that\nthe feature is working as expected.\n\nFor tests involving a new write feature which can already be parsed, appropriate\nfeature tests would involve writing a workbook with the feature and then opening\nand verifying that the feature is preserved.\n\nFor tests involving a new write feature without an existing read ability, please\nadd a feature test to the kitchen sink `tests/write.js`.\n</details>\n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.

I very much like BTT and having a full custom TouchBar (my BTT preset), and I wanted to create it. It's my first Swift project for MacOS :)\n\n**Share your presets [here](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR-presets)**\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./Resources/aaaaa-acc6-17fee7572ed0.png\" alt=\"Mackbook with touchbar\" width=\"800\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/CmNcDuQ\"><img height=\"20px\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/88f53948f291c54736bf08f5fd7b037a848dfc62/68747470733a2f2f646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6173736574732f30376463613830613130326434313439653937333664346231363263666636662e69636f\"> Discord</a>\n<a href=\"https://t.me/joinchat/AmVYGg8vW38c13_3MxdE_g\"><img height=\"20px\" src=\"https://telegram.org/img/t_logo.png\" /> Telegram</a>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WUAAG2HH58WE4\" title=\"Donate via Paypal\"><img height=\"36px\" src=\"Resources/support_paypal.svg\" alt=\"PayPal donate button\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/toxblh\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" height=\"36px\" ></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=9900748\"><img height=\"36px\"  src=\"https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png\" srcset=\"https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button@2x.png 2x\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/my-touchbar-my-rules-mtmr\">\n    <img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=my-touchbar-my-rules-mtmr&theme=light\" alt=\"My TouchBar My Rules (MTMR)\" height=\"36px\" style=\"max-width:100%\">\n</a></p>\n\n## Installation\n\n- Download latest [release](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR/releases) (.dmg) from github\n- Or via Homebrew `brew install --cask mtmr`\n- [Dario Prski](https://medium.com/@urdigitalpulse) has written a [fantastic article on medium](https://medium.com/@urdigitalpulse/customise-your-macbook-pro-touch-bar-966998e606b5) that goes into more detail on installing MTMR\n\n**On first install** you need to allow access for MTMR in Accessibility otherwise buttons like <kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>Volume</kbd>, <kbd>Brightness</kbd> and other system keys won't work.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"screenshot 2019-02-24 at 23 19 20\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2198153/53307057-2b078200-388c-11e9-8212-8c2b1aff0aa6.png\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n\uD83C\uDF4F→ System Preferences → Security and Privacy → tab Privacy → Accessibility → MTMR\n</p>\n\n## Examples\n\n[MTMR presets](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR-presets)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./Resources/Artboard.png\" alt=\"Presets for touchbar\" width=\"800\">\n</p>\n\n## Customization\n\nMTMR preferences are stored in `~/Library/Application\\ Support/MTMR/items.json`.\n\nThe pre-installed configuration contains less or more than you'll probably want, try to configure:\n\n## Built-in button types:\n\n> Buttons\n\n- escape\n- exitTouchbar\n- brightnessUp\n- brightnessDown\n- illuminationUp (keyboard illumination)\n- illuminationDown (keyboard illumination)\n- volumeDown\n- volumeUp\n- mute\n\n> Native Plugins\n\n- timeButton\n- battery\n- cpu\n- currency\n- weather\n- yandexWeather\n- inputsource\n- music (tap for pause, longTap for next)\n- dock (half-long click to open app, full-long click to kill app)\n- nightShift\n- dnd (Don't disturb)\n- darkMode\n- pomodoro\n- network\n- upnext (Calendar events)\n\n> Media Keys\n\n- previous\n- play\n- next\n\n> AppleScript plugins\n\n- sleep\n- displaySleep\n\n> Custom buttons\n\n- staticButton\n- appleScriptTitledButton\n- shellScriptTitledButton\n\n## Gestures\n\nBy default you can enable basic gestures from application menu (status bar -> MTMR icon -> Volume/Brightness gestures):\n- two finger slide: change you Volume\n- three finger slide: change you Brightness\n\n### Custom gestures\n\nYou can add custom actions for two/three/four finger swipes. To do it, you need to use `swipe` type:\n\n```json\n    \"type\": \"swipe\",\n    \"fingers\": 2,            // number of fingers required (2,3 or 4)\n    \"direction\": \"right\",    // direction of swipe (right/left)\n    \"minOffset\": 10,          // optional: minimal required offset for gesture to emit event\n    \"sourceApple\": {         // optional: apple script to run\n        \"inline\": \"beep\"\n    },\n    \"sourceBash\": {          // optional: bash script to run\n        \"inline\": \"touch /Users/lobster/test\"\n    }\n```\n\nYou may create as many `swipe` objects in the preset as you want.\n\n## Built-in slider types:\n\n- brightness\n- volume\n\n### You can also make custom buttons using these types\n\n#### `staticButton`\n\n```json\n \"type\": \"staticButton\",\n \"title\": \"esc\",\n```\n\n#### `appleScriptTitledButton`\n\n```js\n  {\n    \"type\": \"appleScriptTitledButton\",\n    \"refreshInterval\": 60, //optional\n    \"source\": {\n      \"filePath\": \"~/Library/Application Support/MTMR/iTunes.nowPlaying.scpt\",\n      // or\n      \"inline\": \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\"\\rif not (exists window 1) then\\rmake new Finder window\\rset target of front window to path to home folder as string\\rend if\\ractivate\\rend tell\",\n      // or\n      \"base64\": \"StringInbase64\"\n    },\n  }\n```\n\n> Note: You can change appleScriptTitledButton's icon by following these steps:\n1. Declare dictionary of icons in `alternativeImages` field\n2. Make you script return array of two values - `{\"TITLE\", \"IMAGE_LABEL\"}`\n3. Make sure that your `IMAGE_LABEL` is declared in `alternativeImages` field\n\nExample:\n```js\n  {\n    \"type\": \"appleScriptTitledButton\",\n    \"source\": {\n      \"inline\": \"if (random number from 1 to 2) = 1 then\\n\\tset val to {\\\"title\\\", \\\"play\\\"}\\nelse\\n\\tset val to {\\\"title\\\", \\\"pause\\\"}\\nend if\\nreturn val\"\n    },\n    \"refreshInterval\": 1,\n    \"image\": {\n      \"base64\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgA...\"\n    },\n    \"alternativeImages\": {\n      \"play\": {\n        \"base64\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAAA...\"\n      },\n      \"pause\": {\n        \"base64\": \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAIAA...\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n\n#### `shellScriptTitledButton`\n> Note: script may also use escape sequences to return colors (read https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting for more information)\n> \"16 Colors\" is the only mode supported presently. Buttons will set their own background color to the color returned.\n\nExample of \"CPU load\" button which also changes color based on load value (Note: The native `cpu` plugin runs runs better):\n```js\n{\n  \"type\": \"shellScriptTitledButton\",\n  \"width\": 80,\n  \"refreshInterval\": 2,\n  \"source\": {\n    \"inline\": \"top -l 2 -n 0 -F | egrep -o ' \\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d+% idle' | tail -1 | awk -F% '{p = 100 - $1; if (p > 30) c = \\\"\\\\033[33m\\\"; if (p > 70) c = \\\"\\\\033[30;43m\\\"; printf \\\"%s%4.1f%%\\\\n\\\", c, p}'\"\n  },\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"trigger\": \"singleTap\",\n      \"action\": \"appleScript\",\n      \"actionAppleScript\": {\n        \"inline\": \"activate application \\\"Activity Monitor\\\"\\rtell application \\\"System Events\\\"\\r\\ttell process \\\"Activity Monitor\\\"\\r\\t\\ttell radio button \\\"CPU\\\" of radio group 1 of group 2 of toolbar 1 of window 1 to perform action \\\"AXPress\\\"\\r\\tend tell\\rend tell\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"align\": \"right\",\n  \"image\": {\n    // Or you can specify a filePath here.\n    // Images will be resized to 24x24.\n    // \"filePath\": \"~/myproject/myimage.jpg\" // or \"/fixed/path/to/the.png\"\n    \"base64\":\n    \"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\"\n  },\n  \"bordered\": false\n}\n```\n\n## Groups\n\n```js\n{\n  \"type\": \"group\",\n  \"align\": \"center\",\n  \"bordered\": true,\n  \"title\": \"stats\",\n  \"items\": [\n    { \"type\": \"play\" },\n    { \"type\": \"mute\" },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo close a group, use the button:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"close\",\n  \"width\": 64\n},\n```\n\n## Native plugins\n\n#### `cpu`\n\n> Shows current CPU load in percent, changes color based on load value. \n> Has lower power consumption and higher stability than the shell-based solution.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"type\": \"cpu\",\n  \"refreshInterval\": 3,\n  \"width\": 80\n}\n```\n\n#### `timeButton`\n\n> NOTE: Some values don't work properly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations\n\n> formatTemplate examples: https://www.datetimeformatter.com/how-to-format-date-time-in-swift/\n\n> locale examples: https://gist.github.com/jacobbubu/1836273\n\n```js\n{\n  \"type\": \"timeButton\",\n  \"formatTemplate\": \"dd HH:mm\",\n  \"locale\": \"en_GB\",\n  \"timeZone\": \"UTC\"\n}\n```\n\n#### `weather`\n\n> Provider: https://openweathermap.org \\\n> Note: Register at https://openweathermap.org to get your API key \\\n> Note: Wait for 20 minutes or so for Openweathermap to activate your API key.\\\n> Note: Enable MTMR in \"Location Services\" in the \"Security & Privacy\" System Preferences pane\n\n```js\n  \"type\": \"weather\",\n  \"refreshInterval\": 600, // in seconds\n  \"units\": \"metric\", // or imperial\n  \"icon_type\": \"text\", // or images\n  \"api_key\": \"\" // you can get the key on openweather\n```\n\n#### `yandexWeather` (experimental)\n\n> Provider: https://yandex.ru/pogoda.

At this time, `http-head` and `http-contains` are available. Read more about ping services and how to create one below.\n- watchmen provides **custom actions through plugins** (console outpug, email notifications, etc).\n- the code base aims to be simple and easy to understand and modify.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![watchmen, service details](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/watchmen-details-mobile-01.png)\n\n![watchmen, service list](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/watchmen-list-mobile-01.png)\n\n![watchmen, add service](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/watchmen-add.png)\n\n![watchmen, list services](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/watchmen-list-wide-01.png)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\nGet redis from [redis.io](http://redis.io/download) and install it.\n\n### Installing watchmen\n\nClone the repo by using\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:iloire/watchmen.git\n\nor\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/iloire/watchmen.git\n\nThen install the required dependencies using ``npm``\n\n    $ cd watchmen\n    $ npm install\n\n## Running and stopping watchmen\n\nMake sure you have `redis-server` in your `PATH`. Then you can run watchmen services:\n\n    $ redis-server redis.conf\n    $ node run-monitor-server.js\n    $ node run-web-server.js\n\n## Development workflow\n\n### Fetching bower dependencies and building static assets\n\n    $ npm run build\n\n### Dev build watch\n\n    $ npm run build:watch\n\n### Running tests\n\nSee below.\n\n## Managing your node processes with pm2\n\nInstall pm2:\n\n    $ npm install -g pm2\n\nConfigure env variables:\n\n    $ export WATCHMEN_WEB_PORT=8080\n\nRun servers:\n\n    $ pm2 start run-monitor-server.js\n    $ pm2 start run-web-server.js\n\nServer list:\n\n    $ pm2 list\n\n![List of pm2 services](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/pm2-01.png)\n\n## Managing processes with node-foreman\n\n`node-foreman` can be used to run the monitor and web server as an Upstart\nservice. On Ubuntu systems, this allows the usage of `service watchmen start`.\n\nWatchmen already include a `Procfile` so you can also manage with `nf`.\n\n```\n$ npm install -g foreman\n$ nf start\n```\n\nTo export as an Upstart script using the environment variables in a `.env` file:\n\n```\n$ PATH=\"/home/user/.nvm/versions/v5.1.0/bin:$PATH\" nf export -o /etc/init -a watchmen\n```\n\nYou can run this without the `-o /etc/init` flag and move the files to this\ndirectory (or the appropriate Upstart) directory yourself. Make sure you have\nthe correct path to the `node` bin, you can find out with `which node`.\n\nMore documentation on `node-foreman`:\n\nhttps://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfig is set through ``env`` variables.\n\nHave a look at the /config folder for more details, but the general parameters are:\n\n```sh\nexport WATCHMEN_BASE_URL='http://watchmen.letsnode.com'\nexport WATCHMEN_WEB_PORT='8080'\nexport WATCHMEN_ADMINS='admin@domain.com'\nexport WATCHMEN_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID='your-GA-ID'\n```\n\n### Authorization settings (since 2.2.0)\n\nWatchmen uses Google Auth through passportjs for authentication. If your google email is present in ``WATCHMEN_ADMINS`` env variable, you will be able to **manage services**.\n\nMake sure you set the right hostname so the OAuth dance can be negociated correctly:\n\n```sh\nexport WATCHMEN_BASE_URL='http://watchmen.letsnode.com/'\n```\n\nYou will also need to set the Google client ID and secret using ``env`` variables accordingly. (Login into https://console.developers.google.com/ to create them first)\n\n```sh\nexport WATCHMEN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='<your key>'\nexport WATCHMEN_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='<your secret>'\n```\n\n## Disabling authentication\n\nIf you want to disable authentication access and let anyone access and edit your services use:\n\n```\nexport WATCHMEN_WEB_NO_AUTH='true'\n```\n\n## Ping services\n\n### Embedded ping services\n\n#### HTTP-HEAD\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watchmen-ping-http-head\n\n#### HTTP-CONTAINS\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watchmen-ping-http-contains\n\n### Third party contributions\n\n#### NightmareJS Plugin for Watchmen\n\nAllows Nightmare scripts to be executed by a Watchmen instance\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watchmen-ping-nightmare\n\n### Creating your own ping service\n\nPing services are npm modules with the ``'watchmen-ping'`` prefix.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a smtp ping service:\n\n#### a) create a watchmen-ping-smtp module and publish it. This is how a simple HTTP ping service looks like:\n\n```javascript\nvar request = require('request');\n\nfunction PingService(){}\n\nexports = module.exports = PingService;\n\nPingService.prototype.ping = function(service, callback){\n  var startTime = +new Date();\n  request.get({ method: 'HEAD', uri: service.url }, function(error, response, body){\n    callback(error, body, response, +new Date() - startTime);\n  });\n};\n\nPingService.prototype.getDefaultOptions = function(){\n  return {}; // there is not need for UI confi options for this ping service\n}\n```\n\n#### b) npm install it in watchmen:\n\n```sh\n     npm install watchmen-ping-smtp\n```\n\n#### c) create a service that uses that ping service\n\n![Select ping service](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/ping-service-selection.png)\n\n## Monitor plugins\n\n### AWS SES Notifications plugin (provided)\n\nhttps://github.com/iloire/watchmen-plugin-aws-ses\n\n#### Settings\n\n```sh\nexport WATCHMEN_AWS_FROM='your@email'\nexport WATCHMEN_AWS_REGION='your AWS region'\nexport WATCHMEN_AWS_KEY='your AWS Key'\nexport WATCHMEN_AWS_SECRET='your AWS secret'\n\n```\n\n### Nodemailer Notifications plugin (third party contribution)\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watchmen-plugin-nodemailer\n\n### Slack Notifications plugin (third party contribution)\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watchmen-plugin-slack\n\n### Console output plugin (provided)\n\nhttps://github.com/iloire/watchmen-plugin-console\n\n### Creating your own custom plugin\n\nA ``watchmen`` instance will be injected through your plugin constructor. Then you can subscribe to the desired events. Best is to show it through an example.\n\nThis what the console plugin looks like:\n\n```javascript\nvar colors = require('colors');\nvar moment = require('moment');\n\nvar eventHandlers = {\n\n  /**\n   * On a new outage\n   * @param {Object} service\n   * @param {Object} outage\n   * @param {Object} outage.error check error\n   * @param {number} outage.timestamp outage timestamp\n   */\n\n  onNewOutage: function (service, outage) {\n    var errorMsg = service.name + ' down!'.red + '.

A good way is using docker-machine with a local VM: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/\n\nEdit ``docker-compose.env`` and set up the configuration.\n\nThen, to build and run Watchmen, run the following:\n\n```\ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nAfter this Watchmen webserver will be running and exposed in the port 3000 of the docker host.\n\nTo configure, please look `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.env`.\n\n## Terraform scripts for digital-ocean\n\nYou can deploy watchmen in a Digital Ocean droplet in a matter of minutes.\n\n1. Install terraform from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/).\n2. If you don't have one yet, create an account in Digital Ocean. Use [this link](https://m.do.co/c/23602cbcfcc3) to get an initial $10 credit so you can play around with it for free.\n3. Open a terminal in ``terraform/digital-ocean``\n4. Fill up ``user-data.yml`` with your configuration. Don't forget to also setup ``DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`` and ``SSH_FINGERPRINT`` env variables (see apply.sh):\n5. Run ``sh apply.sh`` to create your droplet.\n\nTerraform will create a droplet based on Ubuntu with the necessary packages, compile nodejs from source, install a redis server, install and configure an nginx in front of watchmen, and setup and run watchmen from the latest master using [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).\n\n![watchmen droplet](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/watchmen-droplet-01.png)\n\n## Tests\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Test coverage\n\n```sh\n$ npm run coverage\n```\n\nThen check the coverage reports:\n\n```sh\n$ open coverage/lcov-report/lib/index.html\n```\n\n![watchmen test coverage](https://github.com/iloire/watchmen/raw/master/screenshots/test-coverage-node-01.png)\n\n## Debugging\n\nwatchmen uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)\n\n```sh\nset DEBUG=*\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou can contribute by:\n\n- Addressing one if the items on the TODO list or one of the open issues.\n- Creating monitor plugins.\n- Creating ping services.\n- Reporting bugs.\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [Iván Loire](http://twitter.com/ivanloire)\n- [Oden](https://github.com/Odenius)\n- [Tom Atkinson](https://github.com/Nibbler999)\n- [Martin Bučko](https://github.com/MartinBucko)\n- [Eric Elliott](https://github.com/ericelliott)\n- [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)\n- [Vaios Karampinis](https://github.com/vkarampinis)\n- [Emily Horsman](https://github.com/emilyhorsman)\n- [Luís Bianchin](https://github.com/labianchin)\n- [Marcus Kida](https://github.com/kimar)\n- [Adriano Emerick Cola](https://github.com/adrianocola)\n\n## Style guide\n\nPlease use [semantic commit messages](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)\n\n## History\n\n**3.4.0**\n\n- Add non authenticated access\n- Add redis-store for session persistence\n\n**3.3.1**\n\n- Fixed redis sorted set member uniqueness (zadd). Thanks Adriano Emerick Cola!\n- Add terraform for digital ocean\n\n**3.3.0**\n\n- Add docker-compose\n\n**3.2.0**\n\n- Add collapsed nav-bar in mobile.\n- Mobile friendly admin buttons.\n- Move services menu to sidebar.\n- Add support for node foreman.\n- Request avatar with the current URL scheme.\n- Fix package.json loading when using node >= 5.x\n- Other minor fixes and optimisations.\n\n**3.1.0**\n\n- Only notify on sustained outages in-progress (new ``service.failureThreshold`` property).\n- Introduce a new \"service-error\" event that gets triggered when a ping fails.\n\n**3.0.0**\n\n- Watchmen monitor has been refactored. **There is not backwards compatibility with previous watchmen databases.**\n- Pluggable ping services as separate npm modules (http-head and http contains included).\n- Plugins for watchmen monitor as separate npm modules (console and AWS SES Notifications included).\n- Services are persisted in the database.\n- UI panel to add/edit/delete/reset services.\n- Store latency points. Latency charts.\n- Restricted services to users (by email). Login with Google Auth to access those.\n\n**2.5.0**\n\n- Rewrite notification system (support for postmark and AWS-SES - it is easy to add new ones).\n- Add 'alwaysAlertTo' to notifications.\n- Refactor configuration files. IMPORTANT: Please update your configuration files if you are upgrading (host/service config is still the same)!\n- Use postmark module instead of custom code for talking to postmark service.\n- Add istanbul for test coverage.\n- Fix: Cancel timeout to avoid hammering the server when the controller gets called multiple times.\n- Add colors to server console output.\n\n**2.4.0**\n\n- Frontend revamp using angularjs.\n- Client side pagination using ngTable.\n- Client dependencies now managed by bower.\n- Extract analytics ID to config.\n\n**2.3.0**\n\n- Use passport-google-oauth2 as Google authentication strategy.\n\n**2.2.0**\n\n- Added service/host authorization with passportjs and GoogleStrategy.\n\n**2.1.0**\n\n- Fix issue #7. Make load_services async so eventually services can be fetched form a database or remote server.\n\n**2.0.0**\n\n- Upgrade to Express 4 (requires Node 0.10 or later), hence bumping to 2.x.\n- Bump ejs\n- Remove dynamic helpers\n\n**1.1.1**\n\n- Persist table sorting options in localStorage.\n- Improve styling and responsiveness.\n- General code cleanup.\n- Display date of oldest event stored in the database in details view.\n- Bump redis, moment and ejs.\n- Some other minor changes.\n\n**1.1.0**\n\n- Delete events older than a certain threshold (configurable in a per-host basis)\n- Bump jQuery to 1.11.1\n- Bump Handlebars to 2.0.0\n- Bump bootstrap to 3.2.0\n- Responsive design based on bootstrap\n\n**1.0.alpha1 Major changes and improvements**\n\n- **Storages** are now pluggable. `redis` storage is used by default but you can create your own : `couchdb`, `mongodb`, text file, etc (see lib/storage).\n- **Ping services** are also pluggable now. So far you can use `http` and `smtp` (`smtp` is just checking tcp connection right now). You can create your own or improve the existent ones easily.\n- Watchmen daemon now inherits from `events.EventEmitter`, so you can instanciate it and subscribe to the events of your choice (service_error, service_back, etc) to implement your custom logic (see server.js).\n- [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) has been removed. Watchmen uses handlebars now instead. Faster, simpler code, and avoids some client side memory leacks.\n- Client side is using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com) for rendering dates.\n- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) routes now are handled on /routes\n- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) is used for unit testing. Mocked storages and ping services are used.\n- Configuration is now spread in separate files, under the /config directory\n- Better reporting web interface. **Uptime statistics**. Outages count, warnings count.\n\n**0.9**\n\n- Major refactor, improved performance.\n- Added tests and mocked objects for testing.\n- Separate files for request, utils and watchmen library.\n\n**0.8**\n\n- Removed logging to file.\n- Bug fixing when storing event. Needed to add port to redis key to make it unique.\n- Added callback when sending email to registered problems in delivery.\n\n**0.7**\n\n- **Targets node 0.6.x**\n- Added [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com) for view model binding.\n- Auto **async refresh** main page.\n- **Filter** by name in main page.\n- Added counter (hosts up and down).\n- UI Improvements.\n- Tablesorter sorts status and time tags.\n- Added Google Analytics.\n\n**0.6**\n\n- Added current status info (site is up or down) to database.\n- Added icons to display status (disable, error or ok).\n- TableSorter jQuery plugin orders by status by default.\n\n**0.5**\n\n- Added expiration time to event records.\n- Stores avg response time for each url.\n- Warns if response time > limit.\n- Multiple recipients in notifications.\n- Removed \"retry_in\" option. Watchmen works in a smarter way now.\n- REDIS backend.\n- **Web UI to display reports** (express.js app using REDIS backend).\n\n**0.4**\n\n- Be able to disable entries in config file at url level\n- When site is back, displays and logs information about how long the site has been down.\n\n**0.3**\n\n- Logs \"site down\" and \"site back up\" messages to a file (logs in a different file per host)\n- Fix bug when reading url_conf.attempts on site back.\n\n**0.2**\n\n- Allow POST method (for testing forms).\n- Added Marak/colors.js to output success and error messages.\n- Displays request duration time.\n- Refactoring.\n\n**0.1**\n\n- First release.\n\n## TODO\n\n- Use a beautiful template, like [the Gentella Admin Bootstrap Theme](http://demo.kimlabs.com/gentelella/production/index.html).\n- Regular expressions support in the ``http-contains`` plugin.\n- Define a data expiration period (per service)\n- Handle auth in ping services.\n\n## Third party attribution\n\n- Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/\n- \"Font Awesome by Dave Gandy - http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome\"\n- C3 charts - http://c3js.org/\n- ngTable - http://ng-table.com/\n\n(see package.json and bower.json for a complete list of libraries and dependencies)\n\n## Donations\n\nYou can buy me a beer by sending BTC at 1DQRybRW7cQtRq65qCxkpGNLX9BVjmfJaY.\n\nYeah, it turns out researchers have uncovered that beer release endorphins in our brain that we use as a reward and motivation for coding on open source projects.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 - 2015 Iván Loire\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

    "text" : "# mqttclpro\nMQTT Client with tasker integration Android app\nConnect to any MQTT v3.1 broker and subscribe to topics. Perform Tasker actions on message publish or publish messages on tasker events. The app still might be rough around the edges. \n\nTasker Integration works as follows:\n\n-To publish messages from tasker simply create a action in tasker. The configuration is pretty simple. You may use tasker variables in topic and message.\n\n-To perform action whenever a message is received. Create a event in tasker from the plugin. Currently if any message is published on the topic configured, the event will be fired. need feedback on this as to how you guys want this to be implemented.\n\n-No Ads!\n\n-Add/Remove topics easily!\n\n-Messages are automatically saved!\n\n-SSL support (Experimental)\n\n-Publish Messages\n\n-No notifications as of now. Coming soon!\n\nPlanned features:\nFull SSL support\n\nNotifications\n\nBetter tasker integration according to the feedback from you guys\n\n\nFeedback is highly appreciated!\n\nIf you found the application helpful. Please consider buying me a beer.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nDale Lane - http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=1599 (This was my inspiration)\n\nStackOverflow Community :D\n\nFilePicker - https://github.com/Angads25/android-filepicker\n\nSSL Support - https://gist.github.com/sharonbn/4104301\n"

    "text" : "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fossasia/bodyapps-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fossasia/bodyapps-android)\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/fossasia/bodyapps-android](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/fossasia/bodyapps?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n# bodyapps-android\n\nAndroid app for the #bodyapps project with Gradle  \n\n## Communication\n\nPlease join our communication channels.\n\nMailing List at: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bodyapps\n\nGitter chat at: https://gitter.im/fossasia/bodyapps\n\n\n## Project Setup\n\nMain IDE used by the team is IntelliJ-based [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html). \nTo get started, download and install Android Studio, then choose \"Import Project\" and navigate to the project\nroot. Studio should import the Gradle-based structure without much ado.\n\n### Building\n\n* Install Google Play Services and Google repository using SDK Manager  \n* Restart Android Studio\n* Now you are good to run the app on a connected device\n\nNote: for testing in an emulator, see Emulator section below.\n\n### Eclipse/ADT?\n\nWe feel very comfortable with Android Studio so far and see no need to use ADT. If you want to use\nit anyway, please feel free to contribute patches and/or setup-instructions.\n\n### Emulator\n\nProject requires Play Services which are not available in all versions of the Emulator. We recommend\ntesting on a connected device or via [GenyMotion](http://www.genymotion.com/). When running, \nGenyMotion instances act like connected devices and can be selected via ADB during launch.\n\nTo install Play Store and subsequently Play Services, follow [the instructions here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20121883/how-to-install-google-play-service-in-the-genymotion-ubuntu-13-04-currently-i)\n\n### Google API\n\nTo get information from Google API it is required to create project in Google developer console.  \n* Go to [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/project?authuser=0) then \n  go to projects tab and click on create project.  \n* Enter a project name and create a project.  \n* Then go into the project and navigate to APIs under APIs & auth tab\n* Turn on Google+ API\n* Go to Credentials  under APIs & auth tab and click on Create new client ID\n* Click on Installed Application and select Android\n* Give package name as fossasia.valentina.bodyapp.main and provide your SHA1 key\n  (You can get SHA1 from Eclipse via Windows > Preferences > Android > build)\n* Enable deep linking and click create client ID\n\n### Sync\n\t\t\nYou can test the sync options manually by cloning the web application and running it on local host if you dont want to work with online web service. Simply change the baseURL in Sync.java class according to your local host address and port.\n\n\n# Features of the app\n* Can create and store measurement records.\n* Can add images and notes to measurement records.\n* Can sync measurement records with the server.\n* Can download HDF file for measurement record.\n\n\n# Packages\nThere are five folders (or packages) in the org.fashiontec.bodyapps package.\n* db- Contains the classes that deal with creation of local database.\n* main- Contains the classes dealing with screens of app\n* models- Entity classes\n* managers - Contains the classes dealing with database calls and connects entities with database.\n* sync – Contains classes that deal with syncing measurement records with server.\n\n\n# Activities\nThere are five main screens in the app. And there is an activity for each main screen. All of these activities are in the package org.fashiontec.bodyapps.main\n\n## MainActivity\nThis is the landing activity of the app. Contains buttons which leads to other screens such as saved, create and settings. If there is no user logged in it generates an alert dialog and disable create and saved buttons. At the startup it initiates sync process if Auto sync is turned on.\n### Methods :\n* dialog(String title, String message) - Shows a alert dialog with given title and message\n* onClick(View v) [override] - Handles the clicks of every Button\n* onResume() [override] – Disable and enable buttons according to user’s log in state.\n\n## SettingsActivity\nThis activity provides the screen to log in using Google. It takes user’s name and email from G Plus API and sends it to BodyApps server to create account for user and then get a ID for user. Then it saves those data in local database. When user is logged in, it displays user’s picture from G Plus, user’s name and user’s email. And it will display option to turn auto sync on or off.\n### Methods :\n* signInWithGplus() - Sign in the user to Google plus\n* signOutFromGplus() - Sign out user from Google plus\n* revokeGplusAccess() - Revoking access from Google plus\n* updateUI(boolean isSignedIn) - Update the UI according to signed in or not\n* getProfileInformation() – get profile info from G Plus when connected.\n* onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult result) [override]  -  Try to establish connection if failed\n* onConnected(Bundle arg0) [override]  -  After connecting to Google invoke getProfileInformation(), and initiate connection to BodyApps server.\n### Async Tasks :\n* LoadProfileImage – Loads profile image from G Plus.\n* HttpAsyncTaskUser – This task sends user data to BodyApps server and saves user details in local database according to server reply.\n\n## CreateActivity\nThis activity provides screen to create a measurement record. It is a simple activity with no http calls and only contains two edit texts, two spinners and date picker dialog.\n\n### Methods :\n* updateLabel() – Update the date of birth label when a date is selected\n* setData() – Check the validity of data entered by user.\n* setMeasurement(String name, String email) - Creates a measurement object and person object using entered data and adds the person to database.\n* getID() – Generate a UUID to assign as measurement ID\n* closer() - Closes current view and opens MeasurementActivity\n* dialog(String title, String message) - Shows a alert dialog with given title and message\n \n\n## MeasurementActivity\nThis is the activity which handles adding measures to measurements. This is bit complex and contains one static activity and number of Fragments. If device is portrait mode the screen will only show icon grid and by clicking respective measurement set will open. If device is in landscape mode icon grid and measurement sets will be displayed side by side.\n\n### Methods:\n* DBSaver(Context context) - Saves the measurement to the database\n\n### GridFragment\nThis Fragment handles the grid view which shows icons which lead groups of measures.\n\n### Methods in GridFragment :\n* viewSet(View view) - Sets the view according to the orientation of the device\n* filledSet() – Sets the number of fields filled in each measures group\n* chooseView(int index) – Choose which Fragment to load according to the clicked icon in icon grid.\n\n### ItemActivity\nSupporting activity which loads measurement set fragments when device in portrait mode.\n\nHead, Neck, Shoulder, Chest, Arm, Hand, Leg, Trunk and Heights measurement groups or measurement sets. Each one these are Fragments and contains edit texts where user can enter respective measurements. Some of them contains spinners. These fragments will be loaded directly to MeasurementActivity if device is in landscape mode. Else they will be loaded to ItemActivity.\n### Pics\nThis fragment deals with adding pictures to measurement record. It contains three buttons Front, Side and back. Clicking these buttons will open a dialog where user will be able select their image source or they can remove existing picture.\n### Methods in Pics :\n* captureImage() - Open camera to capture an image\n* openImage() - Open gallery to choose a image\n* removeImage() - Removes a added image\n* getOutputMediaFileUri() - Gives output image file path as a Uri\n* getOutputMediaFile() - Creates output image file folder and creates file path based on file type\n* previewCapturedImage() - Previews selected or captured image\n* compress(Uri inFile, Uri outFile) - Compress the image\n* dialog() - Display dialog with image options such as camera or from file\n\n### Notes\nThis Fragment handles the additional notes added to measurement record.\n\n\n## SavedActivity\nThis activity shows the list of measurements current user has created and it allows options such as edit, delete and getting HDF. This activity contains two Fragments and one static Activity.  If device is in portrait mode the screen will only show list of measurements and by clicking respective measurement it will show the contents.. If device is in landscape mode list and measurement contents will be displayed side by side.\n\n### Methods:\n* edit(String ID) - Go to edit View\n* options(final String ID) - Pops a warning dialog before delete a measurement\n* delete(String ID) - Deletes the given measurement\n* getHDF() - Manages the HDF getting process\n* getPath(String name, String measurementID) - Gives a path to save the HDF\n* mail(String path) - Opens email dialog with HDF attached\n* getDataForListView(Context context) - Gets a List of measurementLisModel objects from database to populate measurement list\n\n### Async Tasks :\n* DownloadFileAsync - Async task to download the HDF\n\n### SavedList\nThis Fragment contains the list that shows measurements.\n\n### Methods in SavedList :\n* viewSet(View view) - Checks for the device’s orientation and adjust the screen according to it.\n\n### ViewSavedActivity\nIf device is in portrait mode this static Activity will load ViewSavedFragment and will show the contents of the measurement selected from list.\n\n### Methods in ViewSavedActivity:\n* edit(String ID) - Go to edit View\n* options(final String ID) - Pops a warning dialog before delete a measurement\n* delete(String ID) - Deletes the given measurement\n\n### ViewSavedFragment\nThis Fragment has bunch of labels in it’s layout and displays contents of selected measurement.

    "text" : "# Android Bootloader Unlocker\n\n## BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices -- Unlock your bootloader without fastboot.\nThis application REQUIRES a Galaxy Nexus (maguro, toro or toroplus), Nexus 4 (mako), Nexus 5 (hammerhead), Nexus 7 2013 (deb or flo), Nexus 10 (manta), or OnePlus One (bacon / A0001), with root.\n\nYou've rooted your device, and you are trying to decide between the security of relocking your bootloader (with stock recovery and USB Debugging off), and the flexibility of leaving it unlocked.\nYou know that in order to prevent an unauthorized user from accessing your data by flashing a custom recovery, fastboot oem unlock wipes your data. This also means that if you relock your bootloader, you will need to do a full backup-and-restore whenever you decide to unlock it again.\nBootUnlocker for Nexus Devices lets you have the best of both worlds by using root privileges to unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your data. This allows you to keep your bootloader locked for security, with this application safely protected behind your lockscreen password. Whenever you want to unlock or relock your bootloader, just unlock your screen and run BootUnlocker.\n\n\n## License\n\nBootUnlocker for Nexus Devices is Open Source Software, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Furthermore, you can now specify the sort order using `-S`. This allows for much easier format selection than what is possible by simply using `--format` ([examples](#format-selection-examples))\n\n* **Merged with animelover1984/youtube-dl**: You get most of the features and improvements from [animelover1984/youtube-dl](https://github.com/animelover1984/youtube-dl) including `--write-comments`, `BiliBiliSearch`, `BilibiliChannel`, Embedding thumbnail in mp4/ogg/opus, playlist infojson etc. Note that the NicoNico livestreams are not available. See [#31](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/31) for details.\n\n* **Youtube improvements**:\n    * All Feeds (`:ytfav`, `:ytwatchlater`, `:ytsubs`, `:ythistory`, `:ytrec`, `:ytnotif`) and private playlists supports downloading multiple pages of content\n    * Search (`ytsearch:`, `ytsearchdate:`), search URLs and in-channel search works\n    * Mixes supports downloading multiple pages of content\n    * Some (but not all) age-gated content can be downloaded without cookies\n    * Fix for [n-sig based throttling](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326)\n    * Redirect channel's home URL automatically to `/video` to preserve the old behaviour\n    * `255kbps` audio is extracted (if available) from youtube music when premium cookies are given\n    * Youtube music Albums, channels etc can be downloaded ([except self-uploaded music](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/723))\n    * Download livestreams from the start using `--live-from-start` (experimental)\n    * Support for downloading stories (`ytstories:<channel UCID>`) \n\n* **Cookies from browser**: Cookies can be automatically extracted from all major web browsers using `--cookies-from-browser BROWSER[+KEYRING][:PROFILE]`\n\n* **Split video by chapters**: Videos can be split into multiple files based on chapters using `--split-chapters`\n\n* **Multi-threaded fragment downloads**: Download multiple fragments of m3u8/mpd videos in parallel. Use `--concurrent-fragments` (`-N`) option to set the number of threads used\n\n* **Aria2c with HLS/DASH**: You can use `aria2c` as the external downloader for DASH(mpd) and HLS(m3u8) formats\n\n* **New and fixed extractors**: Many new extractors have been added and a lot of existing ones have been fixed. See the [changelog](Changelog.md) or the [list of supported sites](supportedsites.md)\n\n* **New MSOs**: Philo, Spectrum, SlingTV, Cablevision, RCN\n\n* **Subtitle extraction from manifests**: Subtitles can be extracted from streaming media manifests. See [commit/be6202f](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/be6202f12b97858b9d716e608394b51065d0419f) for details\n\n* **Multiple paths and output templates**: You can give different [output templates](#output-template) and download paths for different types of files. You can also set a temporary path where intermediary files are downloaded to using `--paths` (`-P`)\n\n* **Portable Configuration**: Configuration files are automatically loaded from the home and root directories. See [configuration](#configuration) for details\n\n* **Output template improvements**: Output templates can now have date-time formatting, numeric offsets, object traversal etc. See [output template](#output-template) for details. Even more advanced operations can also be done with the help of `--parse-metadata` and `--replace-in-metadata`\n\n* **Other new options**: Many new options have been added such as `--concat-playlist`, `--print`, `--wait-for-video`, `--sleep-requests`, `--convert-thumbnails`, `--write-link`, `--force-download-archive`, `--force-overwrites`, `--break-on-reject` etc\n\n* **Improvements**: Regex and other operators in `--format`/`--match-filter`, multiple `--postprocessor-args` and `--downloader-args`, faster archive checking, more [format selection options](#format-selection), merge multi-video/audio, multiple `--config-locations`, `--exec` at different stages, etc\n\n* **Plugins**: Extractors and PostProcessors can be loaded from an external file. See [plugins](#plugins) for details\n\n* **Self-updater**: The releases can be updated using `yt-dlp -U`\n\nSee [changelog](Changelog.md) or [commits](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commits) for the full list of changes\n\n### Differences in default behavior\n\nSome of yt-dlp's default options are different from that of youtube-dl and youtube-dlc:\n\n* The options `--auto-number` (`-A`), `--title` (`-t`) and `--literal` (`-l`), no longer work. See [removed options](#Removed) for details\n* `avconv` is not supported as an alternative to `ffmpeg`\n* yt-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to youtube-dl. See [configuration](#configuration) for a list of correct locations\n* The default [output template](#output-template) is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`. There is no real reason for this change. This was changed before yt-dlp was ever made public and now there are no plans to change it back to `%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s`. Instead, you may use `--compat-options filename`\n* The default [format sorting](#sorting-formats) is different from youtube-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than higher bitrates. You can use the `--format-sort` option to change this to any order you prefer, or use `--compat-options format-sort` to use youtube-dl's sorting order\n* The default format selector is `bv*+ba/b`. This means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than the best video-only format is found, the former will be preferred. Use `-f bv+ba/b` or `--compat-options format-spec` to revert this\n* Unlike youtube-dlc, yt-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of `-f bv*+ba`). If needed, this feature must be enabled using `--audio-multistreams` and `--video-multistreams`. You can also use `--compat-options multistreams` to enable both\n* `--no-abort-on-error` is enabled by default. Use `--abort-on-error` or `--compat-options abort-on-error` to abort on errors instead\n* When writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson, the same information (if available) is also written for playlists. Use `--no-write-playlist-metafiles` or `--compat-options no-playlist-metafiles` to not write these files\n* `--add-metadata` attaches the `infojson` to `mkv` files in addition to writing the metadata when used with `--write-info-json`. Use `--no-embed-info-json` or `--compat-options no-attach-info-json` to revert this\n* Some metadata are embedded into different fields when using `--add-metadata` as compared to youtube-dl. Most notably, `comment` field contains the `webpage_url` and `synopsis` contains the `description`. You can [use `--parse-metadata`](#modifying-metadata) to modify this to your liking or use `--compat-options embed-metadata` to revert this\n* `playlist_index` behaves differently when used with options like `--playlist-reverse` and `--playlist-items`. See [#302](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302) for details. You can use `--compat-options playlist-index` if you want to keep the earlier behavior\n* The output of `-F` is listed in a new format. Use `--compat-options list-formats` to revert this\n* All *experiences* of a funimation episode are considered as a single video. This behavior breaks existing archives. Use `--compat-options seperate-video-versions` to extract information from only the default player\n* Youtube live chat (if available) is considered as a subtitle. Use `--sub-langs all,-live_chat` to download all subtitles except live chat. You can also use `--compat-options no-live-chat` to prevent live chat from downloading\n* Youtube channel URLs are automatically redirected to `/video`. Append a `/featured` to the URL to download only the videos in the home page. If the channel does not have a videos tab, we try to download the equivalent `UU` playlist instead. For all other tabs, if the channel does not show the requested tab, an error will be raised. Also, `/live` URLs raise an error if there are no live videos instead of silently downloading the entire channel. You may use `--compat-options no-youtube-channel-redirect` to revert all these redirections\n* Unavailable videos are also listed for youtube playlists. Use `--compat-options no-youtube-unavailable-videos` to remove this\n* If `ffmpeg` is used as the downloader, the downloading and merging of formats happen in a single step when possible. Use `--compat-options no-direct-merge` to revert this\n* Thumbnail embedding in `mp4` is done with mutagen if possible. Use `--compat-options embed-thumbnail-atomicparsley` to force the use of AtomicParsley instead\n* Some private fields such as filenames are removed by default from the infojson. Use `--no-clean-infojson` or `--compat-options no-clean-infojson` to revert this\n* When `--embed-subs` and `--write-subs` are used together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the media file. You can use just `--embed-subs` to embed the subs and automatically delete the separate file. See [#630 (comment)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460) for more info. `--compat-options no-keep-subs` can be used to revert this\n* `certifi` will be used for SSL root certificates, if installed. If you want to use system certificates (e.g. self-signed), use `--compat-options no-certifi`\n* youtube-dl tries to remove some superfluous punctuations from filenames. While this can sometimes be helpfull, it is often undesirable. So yt-dlp tries to keep the fields in the filenames as close to their original values as possible. You can use `--compat-options filename-sanitization` to revert to youtube-dl's behavior\n\nFor ease of use, a few more compat options are available:\n\n* `--compat-options all`: Use all compat options\n* `--compat-options youtube-dl`: Same as `--compat-options all,-multistreams`\n* `--compat-options youtube-dlc`: Same as `--compat-options all,-no-live-chat,-no-youtube-channel-redirect`\n\n\n# INSTALLATION\n\nYou can install yt-dlp using one of the following methods:\n\n### Using the release binary\n\nYou can simply download the [correct binary file](#release-files) for your OS\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n[![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Windows_x64-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe)\n[![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Linux/MacOS/BSD-red.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp)\n[![Source Tarball](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Source_tar-green.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.tar.gz)\n[![Other variants](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Other-grey.svg?style=for-the-badge)](#release-files)\n[![All versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/-All_Versions-lightgrey.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases)\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\nNote: The manpages, shell completion files etc. are available in the [source tarball](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.tar.gz)\n\n<!-- TODO: Move to Wiki -->\nIn UNIX-like OSes (MacOS, Linux, BSD), you can also install the same in one of the following ways:\n\n```\nsudo curl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\n```\n\n```\nsudo wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -O /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\n```\n\n```\nsudo aria2c https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp --dir /usr/local/bin -o yt-dlp\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp\n```\n\n\n### With [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip)\n\nYou can install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp) with:\n```\npython3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp\n```\n\nYou can install without any of the optional dependencies using:\n```\npython3 -m pip install --no-deps -U yt-dlp\n```\n\nIf you want to be on the cutting edge, you can also install the master branch with:\n```\npython3 -m pip install --force-reinstall https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/archive/master.tar.gz\n```\n\nNote that on some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`\n\n<!-- TODO: Add to Wiki, Remove Taps -->\n### With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)\n\nmacOS or Linux users that are using Homebrew can also install it by:\n\n```\nbrew install yt-dlp/taps/yt-dlp\n```\n\n## UPDATE\nYou can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are [using the provided release](#using-the-release-binary)\n\nIf you [installed with pip](#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program\n\nIf you [installed using Homebrew](#with-homebrew), run `brew upgrade yt-dlp/taps/yt-dlp`\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n## RELEASE FILES\n\n#### Recommended\n\nFile|Description\n:---|:---\n[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp)|Platform-independant binary.

Remove this note once there is new release -->\n**Note**: There are some regressions in newer ffmpeg versions that causes various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds\n\n\n## COMPILE\n\n**For Windows**:\nTo build the Windows executable, you must have pyinstaller (and any of yt-dlp's optional dependencies if needed). Once you have all the necessary dependencies installed, (optionally) build lazy extractors using `devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`, and then just run `pyinst.py`. The executable will be built for the same architecture (32/64 bit) as the python used to build it.\n\n    py -m pip install -U pyinstaller -r requirements.txt\n    py devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py\n    py pyinst.py\n\nNote that pyinstaller [does not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment\n\n**For Unix**:\nYou will need the required build tools: `python`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`, `zip`, `pytest`  \nThen simply run `make`. You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files\n\n**Note**: In either platform, `devscripts/update-version.py` can be used to automatically update the version number\n\nYou can also fork the project on github and run your fork's [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build a release\n\n# USAGE AND OPTIONS\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n    yt-dlp [OPTIONS] [--] URL [URL...]\n\n`Ctrl+F` is your friend :D\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\n<!-- Auto generated -->\n## General Options:\n    -h, --help                       Print this help text and exit\n    --version                        Print program version and exit\n    -U, --update                     Update this program to latest version\n    -i, --ignore-errors              Ignore download and postprocessing errors.\n                                     The download will be considered successful\n                                     even if the postprocessing fails\n    --no-abort-on-error              Continue with next video on download\n                                     errors; e.g. to skip unavailable videos in\n                                     a playlist (default)\n    --abort-on-error                 Abort downloading of further videos if an\n                                     error occurs (Alias: --no-ignore-errors)\n    --dump-user-agent                Display the current user-agent and exit\n    --list-extractors                List all supported extractors and exit\n    --extractor-descriptions         Output descriptions of all supported\n                                     extractors and exit\n    --force-generic-extractor        Force extraction to use the generic\n                                     extractor\n    --default-search PREFIX          Use this prefix for unqualified URLs.

See\n                                     \"EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS\" for details. You can\n                                     use this option multiple times to give\n                                     arguments for different extractors\n\n# CONFIGURATION\n\nYou can configure yt-dlp by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file. The configuration is loaded from the following locations:\n\n1. **Main Configuration**: The file given by `--config-location`\n1. **Portable Configuration**: `yt-dlp.conf` in the same directory as the bundled binary. If you are running from source-code (`<root dir>/yt_dlp/__main__.py`), the root directory is used instead.\n1. **Home Configuration**: `yt-dlp.conf` in the home path given by `-P`, or in the current directory if no such path is given\n1. **User Configuration**:\n    * `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on Linux/macOS)\n    * `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `%APPDATA%/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on Windows)\n    * `%APPDATA%/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf.txt`\n    \n    `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%` defaults to `~/.config` if undefined. On windows, `%APPDATA%` generally points to `C:\\Users\\<user name>\\AppData\\Roaming` and `~` points to `%HOME%` if present, `%USERPROFILE%` (generally `C:\\Users\\<user name>`), or `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`\n\n1. **System Configuration**: `/etc/yt-dlp.conf`\n\nFor example, with the following configuration file yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under `YouTube` directory in your home directory:\n```\n# Lines starting with # are comments\n\n# Always extract audio\n-x\n\n# Do not copy the mtime\n--no-mtime\n\n# Use this proxy\n--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128\n\n# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory\n-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n```\n\nNote that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls; thus there **must be no whitespace** after `-` or `--`, e.g. `-o` or `--proxy` but not `- o` or `-- proxy`.\n\nYou can use `--ignore-config` if you want to disable all configuration files for a particular yt-dlp run. If `--ignore-config` is found inside any configuration file, no further configuration will be loaded. For example, having the option in the portable configuration file prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations. Additionally, (for backward compatibility) if `--ignore-config` is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded.\n\n### Authentication with `.netrc` file\n\nYou may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with `--username` and `--password`) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt-dlp execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per extractor basis. For that you will need to create a `.netrc` file in `--netrc-location` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:\n```\ntouch $HOME/.netrc\nchmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc\n```\nAfter that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:\n```\nmachine <extractor> login <username> password <password>\n```\nFor example:\n```\nmachine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password\nmachine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password\n```\nTo activate authentication with the `.netrc` file you should pass `--netrc` to yt-dlp or place it in the [configuration file](#configuration).\n\nThe default location of the .netrc file is `$HOME` (`~`) in UNIX. On Windows, it is `%HOME%` if present, `%USERPROFILE%` (generally `C:\\Users\\<user name>`) or `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`\n\n# OUTPUT TEMPLATE\n\nThe `-o` option is used to indicate a template for the output file names while `-P` option is used to specify the path each type of file should be saved to.\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#output-template-examples).\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\nThe simplest usage of `-o` is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in `yt-dlp -o funny_video.flv \"https://some/video\"` (hard-coding file extension like this is _not_ recommended and could break some post-processing).\n\nIt may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to [Python string formatting operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting). For example, `%(NAME)s` or `%(NAME)05d`. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations.\n\nThe field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also have some special formatting:\n\n1. **Object traversal**: The dictionaries and lists available in metadata can be traversed by using a `.` (dot) separator. You can also do python slicing using `:`. Eg: `%(tags.0)s`, `%(subtitles.en.-1.ext)s`, `%(id.3:7:-1)s`, `%(formats.:.format_id)s`. `%()s` refers to the entire infodict. Note that all the fields that become available using this method are not listed below. Use `-j` to see such fields\n\n1. **Addition**: Addition and subtraction of numeric fields can be done using `+` and `-` respectively. Eg: `%(playlist_index+10)03d`, `%(n_entries+1-playlist_index)d`\n\n1. **Date/time Formatting**: Date/time fields can be formatted according to [strftime formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) by specifying it separated from the field name using a `>`. Eg: `%(duration>%H-%M-%S)s`, `%(upload_date>%Y-%m-%d)s`, `%(epoch-3600>%H-%M-%S)s`\n\n1. **Alternatives**: Alternate fields can be specified separated with a `,`. Eg: `%(release_date>%Y,upload_date>%Y|Unknown)s`\n\n1. **Replacement**: A replacement value can specified using a `&` separator. If the field is *not* empty, this replacement value will be used instead of the actual field content. This is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement is used if *any* of the alternative fields is *not* empty.\n\n1. **Default**: A literal default value can be specified for when the field is empty using a `|` separator. This overrides `--output-na-template`. Eg: `%(uploader|Unknown)s`\n\n1. **More Conversions**: In addition to the normal format types `diouxXeEfFgGcrs`, `B`, `j`, `l`, `q`, `D`, `S` can be used for converting to **B**ytes, **j**son (flag `#` for pretty-printing), a comma separated **l**ist (flag `#` for `\\n` newline-separated), a string **q**uoted for the terminal (flag `#` to split a list into different arguments), to add **D**ecimal suffixes (Eg: 10M) (flag `#` to use 1024 as factor), and to **S**anitize as filename (flag `#` for restricted), respectively\n\n1. **Unicode normalization**: The format type `U` can be used for NFC [unicode normalization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize). The alternate form flag (`#`) changes the normalization to NFD and the conversion flag `+` can be used for NFKC/NFKD compatibility equivalence normalization. Eg: `%(title)+.100U` is NFKC\n\nTo summarize, the general syntax for a field is:\n```\n%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can set different output templates for the various metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon `:`. The different file types supported are `subtitle`, `thumbnail`, `description`, `annotation` (deprecated), `infojson`, `link`, `pl_thumbnail`, `pl_description`, `pl_infojson`, `chapter`, `pl_video`. For example, `-o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" -o \"thumbnail:%(title)s\\%(title)s.%(ext)s\"`  will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video. If any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written. Eg: `--write-thumbnail -o \"thumbnail:\"` will write thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.\n\nThe available fields are:\n\n - `id` (string): Video identifier\n - `title` (string): Video title\n - `fulltitle` (string): Video title ignoring live timestamp and generic title\n - `url` (string): Video URL\n - `ext` (string): Video filename extension\n - `alt_title` (string): A secondary title of the video\n - `description` (string): The description of the video\n - `display_id` (string): An alternative identifier for the video\n - `uploader` (string): Full name of the video uploader\n - `license` (string): License name the video is licensed under\n - `creator` (string): The creator of the video\n - `timestamp` (numeric): UNIX timestamp of the moment the video became available\n - `upload_date` (string): Video upload date in UTC (YYYYMMDD)\n - `release_timestamp` (numeric): UNIX timestamp of the moment the video was released\n - `release_date` (string): The date (YYYYMMDD) when the video was released in UTC\n - `modified_timestamp` (numeric): UNIX timestamp of the moment the video was last modified\n - `modified_date` (string): The date (YYYYMMDD) when the video was last modified in UTC\n - `uploader_id` (string): Nickname or id of the video uploader\n - `channel` (string): Full name of the channel the video is uploaded on\n - `channel_id` (string): Id of the channel\n - `channel_follower_count` (numeric): Number of followers of the channel\n - `location` (string): Physical location where the video was filmed\n - `duration` (numeric): Length of the video in seconds\n - `duration_string` (string): Length of the video (HH:mm:ss)\n - `view_count` (numeric): How many users have watched the video on the platform\n - `like_count` (numeric): Number of positive ratings of the video\n - `dislike_count` (numeric): Number of negative ratings of the video\n - `repost_count` (numeric): Number of reposts of the video\n - `average_rating` (numeric): Average rating give by users, the scale used depends on the webpage\n - `comment_count` (numeric): Number of comments on the video (For some extractors, comments are only downloaded at the end, and so this field cannot be used)\n - `age_limit` (numeric): Age restriction for the video (years)\n - `live_status` (string): One of \"is_live\", \"was_live\", \"is_upcoming\", \"not_live\"\n - `is_live` (boolean): Whether this video is a live stream or a fixed-length video\n - `was_live` (boolean): Whether this video was originally a live stream\n - `playable_in_embed` (string): Whether this video is allowed to play in embedded players on other sites\n - `availability` (string): Whether the video is \"private\", \"premium_only\", \"subscriber_only\", \"needs_auth\", \"unlisted\" or \"public\"\n - `start_time` (numeric): Time in seconds where the reproduction should start, as specified in the URL\n - `end_time` (numeric): Time in seconds where the reproduction should end, as specified in the URL\n - `format` (string): A human-readable description of the format\n - `format_id` (string): Format code specified by `--format`\n - `format_note` (string): Additional info about the format\n - `width` (numeric): Width of the video\n - `height` (numeric): Height of the video\n - `resolution` (string): Textual description of width and height\n - `tbr` (numeric): Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s\n - `abr` (numeric): Average audio bitrate in KBit/s\n - `acodec` (string): Name of the audio codec in use\n - `asr` (numeric): Audio sampling rate in Hertz\n - `vbr` (numeric): Average video bitrate in KBit/s\n - `fps` (numeric): Frame rate\n - `dynamic_range` (string): The dynamic range of the video\n - `vcodec` (string): Name of the video codec in use\n - `container` (string): Name of the container format\n - `filesize` (numeric): The number of bytes, if known in advance\n - `filesize_approx` (numeric): An estimate for the number of bytes\n - `protocol` (string): The protocol that will be used for the actual download\n - `extractor` (string): Name of the extractor\n - `extractor_key` (string): Key name of the extractor\n - `epoch` (numeric): Unix epoch of when the information extraction was completed\n - `autonumber` (numeric): Number that will be increased with each download, starting at `--autonumber-start`\n - `video_autonumber` (numeric): Number that will be increased with each video\n - `n_entries` (numeric): Total number of extracted items in the playlist\n - `playlist_id` (string): Identifier of the playlist that contains the video\n - `playlist_title` (string): Name of the playlist that contains the video\n - `playlist` (string): `playlist_id` or `playlist_title`\n - `playlist_count` (numeric): Total number of items in the playlist.

Note that the actual filename may be different due to post-processing. Use `--exec echo` to get the name after all postprocessing is complete\n - `formats_table` (table): The video format table as printed by `--list-formats`\n - `thumbnails_table` (table): The thumbnail format table as printed by `--list-thumbnails`\n - `subtitles_table` (table): The subtitle format table as printed by `--list-subs`\n - `automatic_captions_table` (table): The automatic subtitle format table as printed by `--list-subs`\n \n \nAvailable only in `--sponsorblock-chapter-title`:\n\n - `start_time` (numeric): Start time of the chapter in seconds\n - `end_time` (numeric): End time of the chapter in seconds\n - `categories` (list): The SponsorBlock categories the chapter belongs to\n - `category` (string): The smallest SponsorBlock category the chapter belongs to\n - `category_names` (list): Friendly names of the categories\n - `name` (string): Friendly name of the smallest category\n\nEach aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name. For example for `-o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s` and an mp4 video with title `yt-dlp test video` and id `BaW_jenozKc`, this will result in a `yt-dlp test video-BaW_jenozKc.mp4` file created in the current directory.\n\nNote that some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. Such sequences will be replaced with placeholder value provided with `--output-na-placeholder` (`NA` by default).\n\n**Tip**: Look at the `-j` output to identify which fields are available for the particular URL\n\nFor numeric sequences you can use [numeric related formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting), for example, `%(view_count)05d` will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in `00042`.\n\nOutput templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. `-o \"%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\"` which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.\n\nTo use percent literals in an output template use `%%`. To output to stdout use `-o -`.\n\nThe current default template is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`.\n\nIn some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the `--restrict-filenames` flag to get a shorter title.\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n#### Output template and Windows batch files\n\nIf you are using an output template inside a Windows batch file then you must escape plain percent characters (`%`) by doubling, so that `-o \"%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\"` should become `-o \"%%(title)s-%%(id)s.%%(ext)s\"`. However you should not touch `%`'s that are not plain characters, e.g. environment variables for expansion should stay intact: `-o \"C:\\%HOMEPATH%\\Desktop\\%%(title)s.%%(ext)s\"`.\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\n#### Output template examples\n\n```bash\n$ yt-dlp --get-filename -o \"test video.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc\ntest video.webm    # Literal name with correct extension\n\n$ yt-dlp --get-filename -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc\nyoutube-dl test video ''_ä↭\uD835\uDD50.webm    # All kinds of weird characters\n\n$ yt-dlp --get-filename -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc --restrict-filenames\nyoutube-dl_test_video_.webm    # Restricted file name\n\n# Download YouTube playlist videos in separate directory indexed by video order in a playlist\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\n# Download YouTube playlist videos in separate directories according to their uploaded year\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(upload_date>%Y)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\n# Prefix playlist index with \" - \" separator, but only if it is available\n$ yt-dlp -o '%(playlist_index|)s%(playlist_index& - |)s%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc \"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLinuxFoundation/playlists\"\n\n# Download all playlists of YouTube channel/user keeping each playlist in separate directory:\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(uploader)s/%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLinuxFoundation/playlists\"\n\n# Download Udemy course keeping each chapter in separate directory under MyVideos directory in your home\n$ yt-dlp -u user -p password -P \"~/MyVideos\" -o \"%(playlist)s/%(chapter_number)s - %(chapter)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial\"\n\n# Download entire series season keeping each series and each season in separate directory under C:/MyVideos\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -o \"%(series)s/%(season_number)s - %(season)s/%(episode_number)s - %(episode)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://videomore.ru/kino_v_detalayah/5_sezon/367617\"\n\n# Download video as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\title.ext\", subtitles as \"C:\\MyVideos\\subs\\uploader\\title.ext\"\n# and put all temporary files in \"C:\\MyVideos\\tmp\"\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -P \"temp:tmp\" -P \"subtitle:subs\" -o \"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenoz --write-subs\n\n# Download video as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\title.ext\" and subtitles as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\subs\\title.ext\"\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -o \"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" -o \"subtitle:%(uploader)s/subs/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc --write-subs\n\n# Stream the video being downloaded to stdout\n$ yt-dlp -o - BaW_jenozKc\n```\n\n# FORMAT SELECTION\n\nBy default, yt-dlp tries to download the best available quality if you **don't** pass any options.\nThis is generally equivalent to using `-f bestvideo*+bestaudio/best`. However, if multiple audiostreams is enabled (`--audio-multistreams`), the default format changes to `-f bestvideo+bestaudio/best`. Similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt-dlp to stream to `stdout` (`-o -`), the default becomes `-f best/bestvideo+bestaudio`.\n\n**Deprecation warning**: Latest versions of yt-dlp can stream multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg. So, in future versions, the default for this will be set to `-f bv*+ba/b` similar to normal downloads. If you want to preserve the `-f b/bv+ba` setting, it is recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.\n\nThe general syntax for format selection is `-f FORMAT` (or `--format FORMAT`) where `FORMAT` is a *selector expression*, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#format-selection-examples).\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\nThe simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with `-f 22` you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using `--list-formats` or `-F`. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.\n\nYou can also use a file extension (currently `3gp`, `aac`, `flv`, `m4a`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm` are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. `-f webm` will download the best quality format with the `webm` extension served as a single file.\n\nYou can use `-f -` to interactively provide the format selector *for each video*\n\nYou can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:\n\n - `all`: Select **all formats** separately\n - `mergeall`: Select and **merge all formats** (Must be used with `--audio-multistreams`, `--video-multistreams` or both)\n - `b*`, `best*`: Select the best quality format that **contains either** a video or an audio\n - `b`, `best`: Select the best quality format that **contains both** video and audio. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `bv`, `bestvideo`: Select the best quality **video-only** format. Equivalent to `best*[acodec=none]`\n - `bv*`, `bestvideo*`: Select the best quality format that **contains video**. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `ba`, `bestaudio`: Select the best quality **audio-only** format. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec=none]`\n - `ba*`, `bestaudio*`: Select the best quality format that **contains audio**. It may also contain video. Equivalent to `best*[acodec!=none]` ([Do not use!](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/979#issuecomment-919629354))\n - `w*`, `worst*`: Select the worst quality format that contains either a video or an audio\n - `w`, `worst`: Select the worst quality format that contains both video and audio. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `wv`, `worstvideo`: Select the worst quality video-only format. Equivalent to `worst*[acodec=none]`\n - `wv*`, `worstvideo*`: Select the worst quality format that contains video. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `wa`, `worstaudio`: Select the worst quality audio-only format. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec=none]`\n - `wa*`, `worstaudio*`: Select the worst quality format that contains audio. It may also contain video. Equivalent to `worst*[acodec!=none]`\n\nFor example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use `-f worstvideo`. It is however recommended not to use `worst` and related options. When your format selector is `worst`, the format which is worst in all respects is selected. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use `-S +size` or more rigorously, `-S +size,+br,+res,+fps` instead of `-f worst`. See [sorting formats](#sorting-formats) for more details.\n\nYou can select the n'th best format of a type by using `best<type>.<n>`. For example, `best.2` will select the 2nd best combined format. Similarly, `bv*.3` will select the 3rd best format that contains a video stream.\n\nIf you want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example `-f 22/17/18` will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.\n\nIf you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. `-f 22,17,18` will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: `-f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio`.\n\nYou can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file using `-f <format1>+<format2>+...` (requires ffmpeg installed), for example `-f bestvideo+bestaudio` will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg.\n\n**Deprecation warning**: Since the *below* described behavior is complex and counter-intuitive, this will be removed and multistreams will be enabled by default in the future. A new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single audio/video\n\nUnless `--video-multistreams` is used, all formats with a video stream except the first one are ignored. Similarly, unless `--audio-multistreams` is used, all formats with an audio stream except the first one are ignored. For example, `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams` will download and merge all 3 given formats. The resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams. But `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --no-video-multistreams` will download and merge only `bestvideo` and `bestaudio`. `best` is ignored since another format containing a video stream (`bestvideo`) has already been selected. The order of the formats is therefore important. `-f best+bestaudio --no-audio-multistreams` will download and merge both formats while `-f bestaudio+best --no-audio-multistreams` will ignore `best` and download only `bestaudio`.\n\n## Filtering Formats\n\nYou can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in `-f \"best[height=720]\"` (or `-f \"[filesize>10M]\"`).\n\nThe following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=` (equals), `!=` (not equals):\n\n - `filesize`: The number of bytes, if known in advance\n - `width`: Width of the video, if known\n - `height`: Height of the video, if known\n - `tbr`: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s\n - `abr`: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s\n - `vbr`: Average video bitrate in KBit/s\n - `asr`: Audio sampling rate in Hertz\n - `fps`: Frame rate\n\nAlso filtering work for comparisons `=` (equals), `^=` (starts with), `$=` (ends with), `*=` (contains), `~=` (matches regex) and following string meta fields:\n\n - `ext`: File extension\n - `acodec`: Name of the audio codec in use\n - `vcodec`: Name of the video codec in use\n - `container`: Name of the container format\n - `protocol`: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (`http`, `https`, `rtsp`, `rtmp`, `rtmpe`, `mms`, `f4m`, `ism`, `http_dash_segments`, `m3u8`, or `m3u8_native`)\n - `format_id`: A short description of the format\n - `language`: Language code\n\nAny string comparison may be prefixed with negation `!` in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. `!*=` (does not contain). The comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters other than `._-`.\n\nNote that none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the website. Any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for filtering.\n\nFormats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (`?`) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so `-f \"[height<=?720][tbr>500]\"` selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s. You can also use the filters with `all` to download all formats that satisfy the filter. For example, `-f \"all[vcodec=none]\"` selects all audio-only formats.\n\nFormat selectors can also be grouped using parentheses, for example if you want to download the best pre-merged mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480 you can use `-f \"(mp4,webm)[height<480]\"`.\n\n## Sorting Formats\n\nYou can change the criteria for being considered the `best` by using `-S` (`--format-sort`). The general format for this is `--format-sort field1,field2...`.\n\nThe available fields are:\n\n - `hasvid`: Gives priority to formats that has a video stream\n - `hasaud`: Gives priority to formats that has a audio stream\n - `ie_pref`: The format preference\n - `lang`: The language preference\n - `quality`: The quality of the format\n - `source`: The preference of the source\n - `proto`: Protocol used for download (`https`/`ftps` > `http`/`ftp` > `m3u8_native`/`m3u8` > `http_dash_segments`> `websocket_frag` > `mms`/`rtsp` > `f4f`/`f4m`)\n - `vcodec`: Video Codec (`av01` > `vp9.2` > `vp9` > `h265` > `h264` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` > other)\n - `acodec`: Audio Codec (`flac`/`alac` > `wav`/`aiff` > `opus` > `vorbis` > `aac` > `mp4a` > `mp3` > `eac3` > `ac3` > `dts` > other)\n - `codec`: Equivalent to `vcodec,acodec`\n - `vext`: Video Extension (`mp4` > `webm` > `flv` > other). If `--prefer-free-formats` is used, `webm` is preferred.\n - `aext`: Audio Extension (`m4a` > `aac` > `mp3` > `ogg` > `opus` > `webm` > other). If `--prefer-free-formats` is used, the order changes to `opus` > `ogg` > `webm` > `m4a` > `mp3` > `aac`.\n - `ext`: Equivalent to `vext,aext`\n - `filesize`: Exact filesize, if known in advance\n - `fs_approx`: Approximate filesize calculated from the manifests\n - `size`: Exact filesize if available, otherwise approximate filesize\n - `height`: Height of video\n - `width`: Width of video\n - `res`: Video resolution, calculated as the smallest dimension.\n - `fps`: Framerate of video\n - `hdr`: The dynamic range of the video (`DV` > `HDR12` > `HDR10+` > `HDR10` > `HLG` > `SDR`)\n - `tbr`: Total average bitrate in KBit/s\n - `vbr`: Average video bitrate in KBit/s\n - `abr`: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s\n - `br`: Equivalent to using `tbr,vbr,abr`\n - `asr`: Audio sample rate in Hz\n \n**Deprecation warning**: Many of these fields have (currently undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use only the documented field names.\n\nAll fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order. To reverse this, prefix the field with a `+`. Eg: `+res` prefers format with the smallest resolution. Additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated by a `:`. Eg: `res:720` prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p. For `codec` and `ext`, you can provide two preferred values, the first for video and the second for audio. Eg: `+codec:avc:m4a` (equivalent to `+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a`) sets the video codec preference to `h264` > `h265` > `vp9` > `vp9.2` > `av01` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` and audio codec preference to `mp4a` > `aac` > `vorbis` > `opus` > `mp3` > `ac3` > `dts`. You can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided by using `~` as the delimiter. Eg: `filesize~1G` prefers the format with filesize closest to 1 GiB.\n\nThe fields `hasvid` and `ie_pref` are always given highest priority in sorting, irrespective of the user-defined order. This behaviour can be changed by using `--format-sort-force`. Apart from these, the default order used is: `lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,codec:vp9.2,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id`. The extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override the user-provided order.\n\nNote that the default has `codec:vp9.2`; i.e. `av1` is not preferred. Similarly, the default for hdr is `hdr:12`; i.e. dolby vision is not preferred. These choices are made since DV and AV1 formats are not yet fully compatible with most devices. This may be changed in the future as more devices become capable of smoothly playing back these formats.\n\nIf your format selector is `worst`, the last item is selected after sorting. This means it will select the format that is worst in all respects. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use `-f best -S +size,+br,+res,+fps`.\n\n**Tip**: You can use the `-v -F` to see how the formats have been sorted (worst to best).\n\n## Format Selection examples\n\n```bash\n# Download and merge the best video-only format and the best audio-only format,\n# or download the best combined format if video-only format is not available\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv+ba/b\"\n\n# Download best format that contains video,\n# and if it doesn't already have an audio stream, merge it with best audio-only format\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+ba/b\"\n\n# Same as above\n$ yt-dlp\n\n# Download the best video-only format and the best audio-only format without merging them\n# For this case, an output template should be used since\n# by default, bestvideo and bestaudio will have the same file name.\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv,ba\" -o \"%(title)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s\"\n\n# Download and merge the best format that has a video stream,\n# and all audio-only formats into one file\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+mergeall[vcodec=none]\" --audio-multistreams\n\n# Download and merge the best format that has a video stream,\n# and the best 2 audio-only formats into one file\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+ba+ba.2\" --audio-multistreams\n\n\n# The following examples show the old method (without -S) of format selection\n# and how to use -S to achieve a similar but (generally) better result\n\n# Download the worst video available (old method)\n$ yt-dlp -f \"wv*+wa/w\"\n\n# Download the best video available but with the smallest resolution\n$ yt-dlp -S \"+res\"\n\n# Download the smallest video available\n$ yt-dlp -S \"+size,+br\"\n\n\n\n# Download the best mp4 video available, or the best video if no mp4 available\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4] / bv*+ba/b\"\n\n# Download the best video with the best extension\n# (For video, mp4 > webm > flv.

[Backreferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreferences#re.sub) can be used in the replace string for advanced use.\n\nThe general syntax of `--parse-metadata FROM:TO` is to give the name of a field or an [output template](#output-template) to extract data from, and the format to interpret it as, separated by a colon `:`. Either a [python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) with named capture groups or a similar syntax to the [output template](#output-template) (only `%(field)s` formatting is supported) can be used for `TO`. The option can be used multiple times to parse and modify various fields.\n\nNote that any field created by this can be used in the [output template](#output-template) and will also affect the media file's metadata added when using `--add-metadata`.\n\nThis option also has a few special uses:\n\n* You can download an additional URL based on the metadata of the currently downloaded video. To do this, set the field `additional_urls` to the URL that you want to download. Eg: `--parse-metadata \"description:(?P<additional_urls>https?://www\\.vimeo\\.com/\\d+)` will download the first vimeo video found in the description\n\n* You can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media file. To do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a `meta_` prefix. For example, any value you set to `meta_description` field will be added to the `description` field in the file. For example, you can use this to set a different \"description\" and \"synopsis\". To modify the metadata of individual streams, use the `meta<n>_` prefix (Eg: `meta1_language`). Any value set to the `meta_` field will overwrite all default values.\n\n**Note**: Metadata modification happens before format selection, post-extraction and other post-processing operations. Some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your changes.\n\nFor reference, these are the fields yt-dlp adds by default to the file metadata:\n\nMetadata fields            | From\n:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------\n`title`                    | `track` or `title`\n`date`                     | `upload_date`\n`description`,  `synopsis` | `description`\n`purl`, `comment`          | `webpage_url`\n`track`                    | `track_number`\n`artist`                   | `artist`, `creator`, `uploader` or `uploader_id`\n`genre`                    | `genre`\n`album`                    | `album`\n`album_artist`             | `album_artist`\n`disc`                     | `disc_number`\n`show`                     | `series`\n`season_number`            | `season_number`\n`episode_id`               | `episode` or `episode_id`\n`episode_sort`             | `episode_number`\n`language` of each stream  | the format's `language`\n\n**Note**: The file format may not support some of these fields\n\n\n## Modifying metadata examples\n\n```bash\n# Interpret the title as \"Artist - Title\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"title:%(artist)s - %(title)s\"\n\n# Regex example\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:Artist - (?P<artist>.+)\"\n\n# Set title as \"Series name S01E05\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(series)s S%(season_number)02dE%(episode_number)02d:%(title)s\"\n\n# Prioritize uploader as the \"artist\" field in video metadata\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(uploader|)s:%(meta_artist)s\" --add-metadata\n\n# Set \"comment\" field in video metadata using description instead of webpage_url,\n# handling multiple lines correctly\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:(?s)(?P<meta_comment>.+)\" --add-metadata\n\n# Remove \"formats\" field from the infojson by setting it to an empty string\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \":(?P<formats>)\" -j\n\n# Replace all spaces and \"_\" in title and uploader with a `-`\n$ yt-dlp --replace-in-metadata \"title,uploader\" \"[ _]\" \"-\"\n\n```\n\n# EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS\n\nSome extractors accept additional arguments which can be passed using `--extractor-args KEY:ARGS`. `ARGS` is a `;` (semicolon) separated string of `ARG=VAL1,VAL2`. Eg: `--extractor-args \"youtube:player-client=android_embedded,web;include_live_dash\" --extractor-args \"funimation:version=uncut\"`\n\nThe following extractors use this feature:\n\n#### youtube\n* `skip`: One or more of `hls`, `dash` or `translated_subs` to skip extraction of the m3u8 manifests, dash manifests and auto-translated subtitles respectively\n* `player_client`: Clients to extract video data from. The main clients are `web`, `android` and `ios` with variants `_music`, `_embedded`, `_embedscreen`, `_creator` (Eg: `web_embedded`); and `mweb` and `tv_embedded` (agegate bypass) with no variants. By default, `android,web` is used, but tv_embedded and creator variants are added as required for age-gated videos. Similarly the music variants are added for `music.youtube.com` urls. You can use `all` to use all the clients, and `default` for the default clients.\n* `player_skip`: Skip some network requests that are generally needed for robust extraction. One or more of `configs` (skip client configs), `webpage` (skip initial webpage), `js` (skip js player). While these options can help reduce the number of requests needed or avoid some rate-limiting, they could cause some issues. See [#860](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/860) for more details\n* `include_live_dash`: Include live dash formats even without `--live-from-start` (These formats don't download properly)\n* `comment_sort`: `top` or `new` (default) - choose comment sorting mode (on YouTube's side)\n* `max_comments`: Limit the amount of comments to gather. Comma-separated list of integers representing `max-comments,max-parents,max-replies,max-replies-per-thread`. Default is `all,all,all,all`\n    * E.g. `all,all,1000,10` will get a maximum of 1000 replies total, with up to 10 replies per thread. `1000,all,100` will get a maximum of 1000 comments, with a maximum of 100 replies total\n\n#### youtubetab (YouTube playlists, channels, feeds, etc.)\n* `skip`: One or more of `webpage` (skip initial webpage download), `authcheck` (allow the download of playlists requiring authentication when no initial webpage is downloaded. This may cause unwanted behavior, see [#1122](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/1122) for more details)\n* `approximate_date`: Extract approximate `upload_date` in flat-playlist. This may cause date-based filters to be slightly off\n\n#### funimation\n* `language`: Languages to extract. Eg: `funimation:language=english,japanese`\n* `version`: The video version to extract - `uncut` or `simulcast`\n\n#### crunchyroll\n* `language`: Languages to extract. Eg: `crunchyroll:language=jaJp`\n* `hardsub`: Which hard-sub versions to extract. Eg: `crunchyroll:hardsub=None,enUS`\n\n#### crunchyrollbeta\n* `format`: Which stream type(s) to extract. Default is `adaptive_hls` Eg: `crunchyrollbeta:format=vo_adaptive_hls`\n    * Potentially useful values include `adaptive_hls`, `adaptive_dash`, `vo_adaptive_hls`, `vo_adaptive_dash`, `download_hls`, `trailer_hls`, `trailer_dash`\n* `hardsub`: Preference order for which hardsub versions to extract. Default is `None` (no hardsubs). Eg: `crunchyrollbeta:hardsub=en-US,None`\n\n#### vikichannel\n* `video_types`: Types of videos to download - one or more of `episodes`, `movies`, `clips`, `trailers`\n\n#### niconico\n* `segment_duration`: Segment duration in milliseconds for HLS-DMC formats. Use it at your own risk since this feature **may result in your account termination.**\n\n#### youtubewebarchive\n* `check_all`: Try to check more at the cost of more requests. One or more of `thumbnails`, `captures`\n\n#### gamejolt\n* `comment_sort`: `hot` (default), `you` (cookies needed), `top`, `new` - choose comment sorting mode (on GameJolt's side)\n\n#### hotstar\n* `res`: resolution to ignore - one or more of `sd`, `hd`, `fhd`\n* `vcodec`: vcodec to ignore - one or more of `h264`, `h265`, `dvh265`\n* `dr`: dynamic range to ignore - one or more of `sdr`, `hdr10`, `dv`\n\n#### tiktok\n* `app_version`: App version to call mobile APIs with - should be set along with `manifest_app_version`. (e.g. `20.2.1`)\n* `manifest_app_version`: Numeric app version to call mobile APIs with. (e.g. `221`)\n\n#### rokfinchannel\n* `tab`: Which tab to download. One of `new`, `top`, `videos`, `podcasts`, `streams`, `stacks`. (E.g. `rokfinchannel:tab=streams`)\n\n\nNOTE: These options may be changed/removed in the future without concern for backward compatibility\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: MOVE \"INSTALLATION\" SECTION HERE -->\n\n\n# PLUGINS\n\nPlugins are loaded from `<root-dir>/ytdlp_plugins/<type>/__init__.py`; where `<root-dir>` is the directory of the binary (`<root-dir>/yt-dlp`), or the root directory of the module if you are running directly from source-code (`<root dir>/yt_dlp/__main__.py`).

Extractor plugins do not need to be enabled from the CLI and are automatically invoked when the input URL is suitable for it. Postprocessor plugins can be invoked using `--use-postprocessor NAME`.\n\nSee [ytdlp_plugins](ytdlp_plugins) for example plugins.\n\nNote that **all** plugins are imported even if not invoked, and that **there are no checks** performed on plugin code. Use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code\n\nIf you are a plugin author, add [ytdlp-plugins](https://github.com/topics/ytdlp-plugins) as a topic to your repository for discoverability\n\n\n\n# EMBEDDING YT-DLP\n\nyt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.\n\nYour program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. Instead they should use options such as `-J`, `--print`, `--progress-template`, `--exec` etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.\n\nFrom a Python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom yt_dlp import YoutubeDL\n\nURLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']\nwith YoutubeDL() as ydl:\n    ydl.download(URLS)\n```\n\nMost likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at [`yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py`](yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L181).\n\n**Tip**: If you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of `YoutubeDL.extract_info` to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. It will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through `YoutubeDL.sanitize_info` as shown in the [example below](#extracting-information)\n\n## Embedding examples\n\n#### Extracting information\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport yt_dlp\n\nURL = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'\n\n# ℹ️ See help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL) for a list of available options and public functions\nydl_opts = {}\nwith yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:\n    info = ydl.extract_info(URL, download=False)\n\n    # ℹ️ ydl.sanitize_info makes the info json-serializable\n    print(json.dumps(ydl.sanitize_info(info)))\n```\n#### Download using an info-json\n\n```python\nimport yt_dlp\n\nINFO_FILE = 'path/to/video.info.json'\n\nwith yt_dlp.YoutubeDL() as ydl:\n    error_code = ydl.download_with_info_file(INFO_FILE)\n\nprint('Some videos failed to download' if error_code\n      else 'All videos successfully downloaded')\n```\n\n#### Extract audio\n\n```python\nimport yt_dlp\n\nURLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']\n\nydl_opts = {\n    'format': 'm4a/bestaudio/best',\n    #

    "text" : "Union: (A PlayFab-Photon MOBA) README\n========\n1. Overview:\n----\nUnion is a sample multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game for mobile devices, designed to show off Photon and PlayFab integration with a Unity game. It is fast-paced, intense and combat focused, with two teams of players teaming up for a common objective: destroy the enemy’s tower and all enemy players. All the assets, prefabs, models, sounds and code are open source and can be used in your own game.\n\n\n##### This demo illustrates:\n* How to use PlayFab and Facebook for:\n  * Getting and sending authentication tokens\n  * Populate PlayFab account details with Facebook data (profile picture, account name)\n* Use PlayFab TitleData as a string table for 'hot-loading' your game's text content\n* Making Google Play IAP requests and validating the receipt with PlayFab\n* Example of how to create real-time multiplayer MOBA with Photon PUN\n  * Simple game system examples (movement, combat, defense towers, UI, AI)\n  * Dual touchscreen input for mobile platforms\n  * Photon networking implementation using PUN, with extensive examples of Views, Syncs and RPCs\n  * In-game store for character upgrades \n  * Kills and win/loss ratios are tracked via PlayFab PlayerStatistics\n  * Compare your stats to others via PlayFab Leaderboards\n\n\n2. Prerequisites:\n----\nTo get the most from these samples you should:\n* Be familiar with the basics of PlayFab \n* Be familiar with the basics of Photon (PUN)\n* Play:\n  * For best results: \n    * Have the ability to build and deploy to an android device (.apk provided as an alternative)\n    * Have a Facebook account for authentication purposes\n  * Alternatively:\n    * Run in the UnityEditor with mouse support\n    * Requires a Facebook Developer Account to generate an authorization token\n\nTo connect to the PlayFab service, your machine must be running TLS v1.1 or better.\n  * For Windows, this means Windows 7 and above\n    * [Official Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n    * [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)\n\n3. Source Code & Key Repository Components:\n----\nThis repository contains the entire Unity3d project. \n\n#### Main Classes that drive featured functionality:\n* AccountManager\n  * Persistent to control all account properties getters and setters. Communicates with Facebook and PlayFab, and holds every property any of these communications may return. Called anywhere in the game, because account’s properties can be changed on gameplay, on store, and will be shown in profile screen.\n* PhotonManager\n  * Persistent to control connection. Connects to Photon and finds a room on ModeSelect, handles all gameplay syncs and events on MatchRoom, and gets destroyed on EndGame. This maintains connection between scenes.\n* AudioManager\n  * Persistent to handle properties and play music. Has an AudioSource, that keeps playing menu (or gameplay) music in loop, and holds booleans for music enabled, and SFX enabled. Because there is SFX and music in every scene, the manager is persistent.\n\n#### 3rd Party Plugins:\n| Class        | Function           | External Site  |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\n| Photon (PUN) | SDK for accessing networking features | https://www.photonengine.com/en/PUN |\n| OpenIAB      | SDK for accessing native billing APIs   | https://github.com/onepf/OpenIAB |\n| Unity-GCM | SDK for registering to the GCM service | https://github.com/kobakei/unity-gcm |\n| Facebook | SDK for accessing Facebook APIs | https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity |\n\n#### Singleton Usage, allows easy access to these systems from anywhere in the project\n##### Documented here for posterity:\n* AccountManager\n* PlayFabManager\n* AudioManager\n* GameController\n* GameplayUI\n* PlayFabPlayerStats\n* PlayFabItemsController\n* GunDropsManager\n* GameController\n* GameplaySFXManager\n* InputManager\n* PushNotificationsManager\n* MultiplayerRoomsManager\n* ChatManager\n* InGameStoreAndCurrencyManager\n* InAppPurchaseManager\n\n\n4. Installation & Configuration Instructions:\n----\nAfter downloading, the Unity project will be under the Project folder.\nIf some errors occurs, it is recommended to delete the folder Photon Unity Networking, and re-import the plugin PUN from Asset Store.\n\n##### How to run the game in editor mode:\n* This requires you to have access to a Facebook developer account\n1. Find a Facebook App ID to use\n2. Enter the App ID in the Unity Facebook SDK editor menu (Facebook > Edit Settings > [App ID located in the inspector panel, paste in your App ID])\n3. Open the Landing.unity scene, Play in editor\n4. While logged in as a Facebook developer, navigate to the Facebook Access Token Tool \n  * https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/\n5. Enter the provided UserToken as your credential\n6. To enable mouse support:\n  * Find the GameControls GameObject in the scene\n  * Check the UseWithMouse property on the InputManager \n  * [note:] the mouse is acts as a single touch input. Although it may be a bit awkward in the editor, click->dragging on the left-half of the screen will move the character directionally, while click->dragging on the right-half of the screen will shoot directionally. For best results play on a multi-touch Android device.\n\n##### How to replicate the Union PlayFab environment to your own title\n* InAppPurchasing will require you to have your own GooglePlay Account information\n* Obtain your own Photon Application ID via the Game Manager > Servers > Photon\n\n1. Upload the game logic (/Documentation/CloudScript.js) via the Game Manager > Servers > CloudScripts > Create New Revision\n2. Upload the game item catalog (/Documentation/InGameStore.json) via the Game Manager > Economy > Catalogs > Upload JSON\n3. Upload the TitleData via the [Admin API](https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Admin/method/SetTitleData)\n  * Run the following command for each title data element in /Documentation/TitleData.json:\n    `\n    curl -XPOST https://2ABE.playfabapi.com/admin/SetTitleData \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"X-SecretKey: 000-ENTER-YOUR-KEY-HERE-000\" \\\n    -d \"COPY AND PASTE EACH ELEMENT FROM /Documentation/TitleData.json\"   \n    `\n4. Ensure your title's virtual currencies match those listed in /Documentation/VirtualCurrencies.json:\n  --EITHER--\n  1. Manually adding them via the Game Manager > Economy > Currencies\n  --OR--\n  2. Run the following [Admin command](https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Admin/method/AddVirtualCurrencyTypes) with the data in /Documentation/VirtualCurrencies.json:\n    `\n    curl -XPOST https://2ABE.playfabapi.com/admin/AddVirtualCurrencyTypes \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -H \"X-SecretKey: 000-ENTER-YOUR-KEY-HERE-000\" \\\n    -d \"COPY AND PASTE THE CONTENTS FROM /Documentation/VirtualCurrencies.json\" \n    `\n\n5. Usage Instructions:\n----\nThe game must​ be played (started) from the Landing scene. It will initialize all the needed references (Facebook, PlayFab, audio manager, etc), and start the login process, to be able to access all features, and properly connect to Photon and join a room.\n\nSee extra documentation:\n  1. Documentation/Union-Usagedocument.pdf\n  2. Documentation/Union Visual Guide.pptx\n\n6. Troubleshooting:\n----\nFor a complete list of available PlayFab APIs, check out the [online documentation](http://api.playfab.com/Documentation/).\n\n#### Contact Us\nWe love to hear from our developer community! \nDo you have ideas on how we can make our products and services better? \n\nOur Developer Success Team can assist with answering any questions as well as process any feedback you have about PlayFab services.\n\n[Forums, Support and Knowledge Base](https://support.playfab.com/support/home)\n\n#### Known Issues:\n* Complete build for Android only. Building to other platforms may not work as expected\n* PUN does not currently support Photon webhooks\n* PlayerName & HealthBar UI sometimes separate from the actor GameObject\n* TouchScreen joystick UI is not under the touch\n\n7.

First being the easiest and the most user friendly.\n\n### Run as a Home Assistant addon\n\nBy far the easiest option that also provides auto-update through Home Assistant Supervisor.\n\nInstallation instructions: refer to https://github.com/resoai/TileBoard-addon/blob/main/README.md#installation\n\nCheck the instructions within the addon on how to edit and customize the configuration.\n\n### Run within a standalone server through Docker\n\nRuns a standalone local HTTP server, independently from the Home Assistant itself.\n\nSetup instructions: refer to https://github.com/resoai/TileBoard/blob/master/docker/README.md\n\n### Run within the public Home Assistant www directory\n\n1. Download the latest release zip file (`Tileboard.zip`) from https://github.com/resoai/TileBoard/releases and unpack to a directory of your choice. (Alternatively you can checkout the repo and build the app manually. Check [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.)\n2. In chosen directory rename `config.example.js` to `config.js` and adjust it for your needs\n3. Optionally create an empty `styles/custom.css` file. Everything will work without it but there will be a network request error logged in the console which can be annoying to some.\n4. Create a directory called `tileboard` inside `www` directory in HA's config path and copy all unpacked files there.\n5. TileBoard will be available at `http://HASS_IP:8123/local/tileboard/index.html` and will prompt you for your login credentials after restarting Home Assistant.\n\n#### !!!WARNING!!!\n\nFiles served from the `www` folder (`/local/` url), aren't protected by the Home Assistant authentication. Files stored in this folder, if the URL is known, can be accessed by anybody without authentication. Please make sure that your HA instance is not exposed via Internet or at least that long-lived token is not hardcoded in the config.\n\n## Configure\n\n`config.js` will initialize a global CONFIG object. If you want to have several config files, you can create another one next to `config.js` and name it for example `bedroom.js`. The specific config will be available at `http://HASS_IP:8123/local/tileboard/index.html?config=bedroom`.\n\nThis config object has the following fields:\n\n```js\nvar CONFIG = {\n   /* customTheme: specify a custom theme for your dashboard\n    * Valid options: null, CUSTOM_THEMES.TRANSPARENT, CUSTOM_THEMES.MATERIAL, CUSTOM_THEMES.MOBILE, CUSTOM_THEMES.COMPACT, CUSTOM_THEMES.HOMEKIT, CUSTOM_THEMES.WINPHONE, CUSTOM_THEMES.WIN95 or a custom theme you have created\n    * Default: null.

Useful for automation to do things like opening a camera view if it detects motion, or turning the screen off on a tablet at night or when everyone leaves.\n\nEvents in HomeAssistant must be fired with `tileboard` as the event type, and a `command` included in the event data.\n\n```js\nevents: [\n    /* Example: Start the screensaver on a tablet with Fully Kiosk Browser */\n    {\n      /* command: The command sent from Home Assistant */\n      command: 'screen_off',\n      /* action: Function to execute when the command is received\n       * The variable e contains the full event_data from HomeAssistant\n       */\n      action: function(e) {\n        if (window.fully) {\n            window.fully.startScreensaver();\n        }\n      },\n    },\n    /* Example: End the screensaver and make sure Fully Kiosk Browser is in\n     * the foreground.\n     */\n    {\n      command: 'screen_on',\n      action: function(e) {\n        if (window.fully) {\n          window.fully.stopScreensaver();\n          window.fully.bringToForeground();\n        }\n      },\n    },\n    /* Example: Play a sound file\n     * Include sound_url in the event_data from Home Assistant\n     */\n    {\n      command: 'play_sound',\n      action: function(e) {\n        window.playSound(e.sound_url);\n      }\n    },\n    /* Example: Open a specific TileBoard page\n     * Include a page field in the event_data from Home Assistant\n     * that matches the id: of a page in the TileBoard CONFIG\n     */\n    {\n      command: 'open_page',\n      action: function(e) {\n        window.openPage(CONFIG.pages[e.page]);\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n```\nExample to fire an event in a [Home Assistant automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/).\nThis example will make 'TileBoard' return to page 0 when a specific `binary_sensor` state change from `off` to `on`.\n*Tip: The page number is determinate by the order of the pages in your TileBoard `CONFIG` file, the first one is `0`.*\n```yaml\n- alias: aquarium_ok\n  initial_state: true\n  trigger:\n    platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.seneye_param_status\n    from: 'on'\n    to: 'off'\n  action:\n    - event: tileboard\n      event_data:\n        page: 0\n        command: 'open_page'\n```\n## Notifications\nTileBoard has built-in support for toast notification popups in the\nlower right corner. To set them up, add the following to `events` in `CONFIG`:\n```js\n{\n   command: 'notify',\n   action: function(e) {\n      window.Noty.addObject(e);\n   }\n}\n```\nExample to fire a notification in a [Home Assistant automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/).\nThis example will fire a persistent red notification on TileBoard when a specific `binary_sensor` state change from `on` to `off`.\n* Tip: To remove the persistent notification, resend the same one (or another one) with the same `id:` with the `lifetime: 1` added at the end of the `event_data`.*\n```yaml\n- alias: PC2_offline\n  initial_state: true\n  trigger:\n    platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.pc2\n    from: 'on'\n    to: 'off'\n  action:\n    - event: tileboard\n      event_data:\n        command: 'notify'\n        id: 'PC2'\n        icon: 'mdi-desktop-tower'\n        type: 'error'\n        title: 'Status - PC2'\n        message: 'PC2 is offline, restart the left computer (big one)'\n```\n`id`: Notification ID. Sending multiple notifications with the same `id` will overwrite each other.\n\n`type`: Type of notification (for style purposes). Valid types are `error`, `info`, `success`, `warning`\n\n`lifetime`: Length of time (in seconds) for the notification to persist before automatically dismissing. Leave a lifetime out of the event_data for persistent messages.\n\n## Custom CSS Styles\nSeveral classes are added to each tile depending on the type of tile and state. Custom CSS styles can be applied by creating a `custom.css` file in the `styles` directory.\n*Tip: If no style is applied after adding the file, make sure to disable cache in the browser as it may cache the previous empty `custom.css` file for a while.*\n\n## Tablet and mobile configuration\nFor the tablet configuration use `COMPACT` custom theme and reduce padding.\nFor the mobiles check out [wiki article](https://github.com/resoai/TileBoard/wiki/Mobile-configuration).\n\n## License\nMIT License\n"

Check it out for more details about how to use Firestack.\n\n## Why?\n\nFirebase is awesome and it's combination with the Google Cloud Platform makes it super awesome. Sadly, the latest version of Firebase requires the `window` object. That's where Firestack comes in! Firestack provides a really thin layer that sits on top of the native Firebase SDKs and attempts to use the JavaScript library as much as possible rather than reinventing the wheel.\n\n## Installing\n\nGetting `react-native-firestack` up and running in your app should be a 2 step process + 1 for each platform.\n\n1. Install the `npm` package\n2. Link the project with `react-native link react-native-firestack`\n3. To ensure Android is setup, check your `MainApplication.java` for the `FirestackPackage()` line.\n\nThose steps in more detail:\n\nInstall the `npm` package with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-native-firestack --save\n```\n\nTo use Firestack, we'll need to have a development environment that includes the same prerequisites of Firebase.\n\n### iOS (with cocoapods)\n\nUnfortunately, due to AppStore restrictions, we currently do _not_ package Firebase libraries in with Firestack. However, the good news is we've automated the process (with many thanks to the Auth0 team for inspiration) of setting up with cocoapods. This will happen automatically upon linking the package with `react-native-cli`.\n\n**Remember to use the `ios/[YOUR APP NAME].xcworkspace` instead of the `ios/[YOUR APP NAME].xcproj` file from now on**.\n\nWe need to link the package with our development packaging. We have two options to handle linking:\n\n#### Automatically with react-native-cli\n\nReact native ships with a `link` command that can be used to link the projects together, which can help automate the process of linking our package environments.\n\n```bash\nreact-native link react-native-firestack\n```\n\nUpdate the newly installed pods once the linking is done:\n\n```bash\ncd ios && pod update --verbose\n```\n\n#### Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use `rnpm`, we can manually link the package together with the following steps, after `npm install`:\n\n1. In XCode, right click on `Libraries` and find the `Add Files to [project name]`.\n\n![Add library to project](http://d.pr/i/2gEH.png)\n\n2. Add the `node_modules/react-native-firestack/ios/Firestack.xcodeproj`\n\n![Firebase.xcodeproj in Libraries listing](http://d.pr/i/19ktP.png)\n\n3. Ensure that the `Build Settings` of the `Firestack.xcodeproj` project is ticked to _All_ and it's `Header Search Paths` include both of the following paths _and_ are set to _recursive_:\n\n  1. `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React`\n  2. `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React`\n  3. `${PROJECT_DIR}/../../../ios/Pods`\n\n![Recursive paths](http://d.pr/i/1hAr1.png)\n\n4. Setting up cocoapods\n\nSince we're dependent upon cocoapods (or at least the Firebase libraries being available at the root project -- i.e. your application), we have to make them available for Firestack to find them.\n\nUsing cocoapods is the easiest way to get started with this linking. Add or update a `Podfile` at `ios/Podfile` in your app with the following:\n\n```ruby\nsource 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\n[\n  'Firebase/Core',\n  'Firebase/Auth',\n  'Firebase/Storage',\n  'Firebase/Database',\n  'Firebase/RemoteConfig',\n  'Firebase/Messaging'\n].each do |lib|\n  pod lib\nend\n\ntarget '[project name]' do\nend\n\n# target '[project test name]' do\n# end\n```\n\nThen you can run `(cd ios && pod install)` to get the pods opened. If you do use this route, remember to use the `.xcworkspace` file.\n\nIf you don't want to use cocoapods, you don't need to use it! Just make sure you link the Firebase libraries in your project manually. For more information, check out the relevant Firebase docs at [https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#frameworks](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#frameworks).\n\n### Android\n\nFull Android support is coming soon, as it currently supports a smaller feature-set than the iOS version. Just as we do with iOS, we'll need to install the library using `npm` and call `link` on the library:\n\n```bash\nreact-native link react-native-firestack\n```\n\nFirestack includes the Firebase libraries and will link those directly into our project automatically.\n\n#### Manually\n\nTo install `react-native-firestack` manually in our project, we'll need to import the package from `io.fullstack.firestack` in our project's `android/app/src/main/java/com/[app name]/MainApplication.java` and list it as a package for ReactNative in the `getPackages()` function:\n\n```java\npackage com.appName;\n// ...\nimport io.fullstack.firestack.FirestackPackage;\n// ...\npublic class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {\n    // ...\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n          new MainReactPackage(),\n            new FirestackPackage()\n      );\n    }\n  };\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nWe'll also need to list it in our `android/app/build.gradle` file as a dependency that we want React Native to compile. In the `dependencies` listing, add the `compile` line:\n\n```java\ndependencies {\n  compile project(':react-native-firestack')\n}\n```\n\nAdd to `AndroidManifest.xml` file\n```diff\n  <activity android:name=\"com.facebook.react.devsupport.DevSettingsActivity\" />\n+   <service android:name=\"io.fullstack.firestack.FirestackMessagingService\">\n+     <intent-filter>\n+       <action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\"/>\n+     </intent-filter>\n+   </service>\n\n+   <service android:name=\"io.fullstack.firestack.FirestackInstanceIdService\" android:exported=\"false\">\n+     <intent-filter>\n+       <action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.INSTANCE_ID_EVENT\"/>\n+     </intent-filter>\n+   </service>\n```\n\n## Firebase setup\n\nThe Firestack library is intended on making it easy to work with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and provides a small native shim to the Firebase native code.\n\nTo add Firebase to your project, make sure to create a project in the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console)\n\n![Create a new project](http://d.pr/i/17cJ2.png)\n\nEach platform uses a different setup method after creating the project.\n\n### iOS\n\nAfter creating a Firebase project, click on the [Add Firebase to your iOS app](http://d.pr/i/3sEL.png) and follow the steps from there to add the configuration file. You do _not_ need to set up a cocoapods project (this is already done through firestack). Make sure not to forget the `Copy Files` phase in iOS.\n\n[Download the Firebase config file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) and place it in your app directory next to your app source code:\n\n![GoogleService-Info.plist](http://d.pr/i/1eGev.png)\n\nOnce you download the configuration file, make sure you place it in the root of your Xcode project. Every different Bundle ID (aka, even different project variants needs their own configuration file).\n\nLastly, due to some dependencies requirements, Firestack supports iOS versions 8.0 and up. Make sure to update the minimum version of your iOS app to `8.0`.\n\n### Android\n\nThere are several ways to setup Firebase on Android. The _easiest_ way is to pass the configuration settings in JavaScript. In that way, there is no setup for the native platform.\n\n#### google-services.json setup\nIf you prefer to include the default settings in the source of your app, download the `google-services.json` file provided by Firebase in the _Add Firebase to Android_ platform menu in your Firebase configuration console.\n\nNext you'll have to add the google-services gradle plugin in order to parse it.\n\nAdd the google-services gradle plugin as a dependency in the *project* level build.gradle\n`android/build.gradle`\n```java\nbuildscript {\n  // ...\n  dependencies {\n    // ...\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.0.0'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn your app build.gradle file, add the gradle plugin at the VERY BOTTOM of the file (below all dependencies)\n`android/app/build.gradle`\n```java\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter creating a Firebase project and installing the library, we can use it in our project by importing the library in our JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nimport Firestack from 'react-native-firestack'\n```\n\nWe need to tell the Firebase library we want to _configure_ the project. Firestack provides a way to configure both the native and the JavaScript side of the project at the same time with a single command:\n\n```javascript\nconst firestack = new Firestack();\n```\n\nWe can pass _custom_ options by passing an object with configuration options. The configuration object will be generated first by the native configuration object, if set and then will be overridden if passed in JS. That is, all of the following key/value pairs are optional if the native configuration is set.\n\n| option           | type | Default Value           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| debug | bool | false | When set to true, Firestack will log messages to the console and fire `debug` events we can listen to in `js` |\n| bundleID | string | Default from app `[NSBundle mainBundle]` | The bundle ID for the app to be bundled with |\n| googleAppID | string | \"\" | The Google App ID that is used to uniquely identify an instance of an app. |\n| databaseURL | string | \"\" | The database root (i.e. https://my-app.firebaseio.com) |\n| deepLinkURLScheme | string | \"\" | URL scheme to set up durable deep link service |\n| storageBucket | string | \"\" | The Google Cloud storage bucket name |\n| androidClientID | string | \"\" | The Android client ID used in Google AppInvite when an iOS app has it's android version |\n| GCMSenderID | string | \"\" | The Project number from the Google Developer's console used to configure Google Cloud Messaging |\n| trackingID | string | \"\" | The tracking ID for Google Analytics |\n| clientID | string | \"\" | The OAuth2 client ID for iOS application used to authenticate Google Users for signing in with Google |\n| APIKey | string | \"\" | The secret iOS API key used for authenticating requests from our app |\n\nFor instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst configurationOptions = {\n  debug: true\n};\nconst firestack = new Firestack(configurationOptions);\nfirestack.on('debug', msg => console.log('Received debug message', msg))\n```\n\n## API documentation\n\nFirestack is broken up into multiple parts, based upon the different API features that Firebase provides.\n\nAll methods return a promise.\n\n### Authentication\n\nFirestack handles authentication for us out of the box, both with email/password-based authentication and through oauth providers (with a separate library to handle oauth providers).\n\n> Android requires the Google Play services to installed for authentication to function.\n\n#### listenForAuth()\n\nFirebase gives us a reactive method for listening for authentication. That is we can set up a listener to call a method when the user logs in and out. To set up the listener, call the `listenForAuth()` method:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.listenForAuth(function(evt) {\n  // evt is the authentication event\n  // it contains an `error` key for carrying the\n  // error message in case of an error\n  // and a `user` key upon successful authentication\n  if (!evt.authenticated) {\n    // There was an error or there is no user\n    console.error(evt.error)\n  } else {\n    // evt.user contains the user details\n    console.log('User details', evt.user);\n  }\n})\n.then(() => console.log('Listening for authentication changes'))\n```\n\n#### unlistenForAuth()\n\nWe can remove this listener by calling the `unlistenForAuth()` method. This is important to release resources from our app when we don't need to hold on to the listener any longer.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.unlistenForAuth()\n```\n\n#### createUserWithEmail()\n\nWe can create a user by calling the `createUserWithEmail()` function. The `createUserWithEmail()` accepts two parameters, an email and a password.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.createUserWithEmail('ari@fullstack.io', '123456')\n  .then((user) => {\n    console.log('user created', user)\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error('An error occurred', err);\n  })\n```\n\n#### signInWithEmail()\n\nTo sign a user in with their email and password, use the `signInWithEmail()` function. It accepts two parameters, the user's email and password:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.signInWithEmail('ari@fullstack.io', '123456')\n  .then((user) => {\n    console.log('User successfully logged in', user)\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error('User signin error', err);\n  })\n```\n\n#### signInWithCustomToken()\n\nTo sign a user using a self-signed custom token, use the `signInWithCustomToken()` function. It accepts one parameter, the custom token:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.signInWithCustomToken(TOKEN)\n  .then((user) => {\n    console.log('User successfully logged in', user)\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error('User signin error', err);\n  })\n```\n\n#### signInWithProvider()\n\nWe can use an external authentication provider, such as twitter/facebook for authentication. In order to use an external provider, we need to include another library to handle authentication.\n\n> By using a separate library, we can keep our dependencies a little lower and the size of the application down.\n\n### OAuth setup with library\n\n[Currently undergoing updates]\n\n### socialLogin with custom Library\nIf you don't want to use [react-native-oauth](https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-oauth), you can use other library such as [react-native-facebook-login](https://github.com/magus/react-native-facebook-login).\n\n```javascript\nvar {FBLogin, FBLoginManager} = require('react-native-facebook-login');\n\nvar Login = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <FBLogin\n        onLogin={function(data){\n          console.log(\"Logged in!\");\n          console.log(data);\n          let token = data.credentials.token\n          firestack.auth.signInWithProvider('facebook', token, '') // facebook need only access token.\n            .then((user)=>{\n              console.log(user)\n            })\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf the `signInWithProvider()` method resolves correct and we have already set up our `listenForAuth()` method properly, it will fire and we'll have a logged in user through Firebase.\n\n### reauthenticateWithCredentialForProvider()\n\nWhen the auth token has expired, we can ask firebase to reauthenticate with the provider. This method accepts the _same_ arguments as `signInWithProvider()` accepts.\n\n#### updateUserEmail()\n\nWe can update the current user's email by using the command: `updateUserEmail()`. It accepts a single argument: the user's new email:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.updateUserEmail('ari+rocks@fullstack.io')\n  .then((res) => console.log('Updated user email'))\n  .catch(err => console.error('There was an error updating user email'))\n```\n\n#### updateUserPassword()\n\nWe can update the current user's password using the `updateUserPassword()` method. It accepts a single parameter: the new password for the current user\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.updateUserPassword('somethingReallyS3cr3t733t')\n  .then(res => console.log('Updated user password'))\n  .catch(err => console.error('There was an error updating your password'))\n```\n\n### sendPasswordResetWithEmail()\n\nTo send a password reset for a user based upon their email, we can call the `sendPasswordResetWithEmail()` method. It accepts a single parameter: the email of the user to send a reset email.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.sendPasswordResetWithEmail('ari+rocks@fullstack.io')\n  .then(res => console.log('Check your inbox for further instructions'))\n  .catch(err => console.error('There was an error :('))\n```\n\n#### updateUserProfile()\n\nTo update the current user's profile, we can call the `updateUserProfile()` method.\n\nIt accepts a single parameter:\n\n* object which contains updated key/values for the user's profile. Possible keys are listed [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/manage-users#update_a_users_profile).\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.updateUserProfile({\n  displayName: 'Ari Lerner'\n})\n  .then(res => console.log('Your profile has been updated'))\n  .catch(err => console.error('There was an error :('))\n```\n\n#### deleteUser()\n\nIt's possible to delete a user completely from your account on Firebase. Calling the `deleteUser()` method will take care of this for you.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.deleteUser()\n.then(res => console.log('Sad to see you go'))\n.catch(err => console.error('There was an error - Now you are trapped!'))\n```\n\n#### getToken()\n\nIf you want user's token, use `getToken()` method.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.getToken()\n.then(res => console.log(res.token))\n.catch(err => console.error('error'))\n```\n\n#### signOut()\n\nTo sign the current user out, use the `signOut()` method. It accepts no parameters\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.signOut()\n.then(res => console.log('You have been signed out'))\n.catch(err => console.error('Uh oh... something weird happened'))\n```\n\n#### getCurrentUser()\n\nAlthough you _can_ get the current user using the `getCurrentUser()` method, it's better to use this from within the callback function provided by `listenForAuth()`. However, if you need to get the current user, call the `getCurrentUser()` method:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.auth.getCurrentUser()\n.then(user => console.log('The currently logged in user', user))\n.catch(err => console.error('An error occurred'))\n```\n\n### Analytics\n\nWouldn't it be nice to send analytics about your app usage from your users? Well, you totally can! The Firebase analytics console is incredibly useful and Firestack has a method for interacting with it. You can send any event with contextual information, which automatically includes the currently logged in user using the `logEventWithName()` method. It accepts two parameters: the name of the event and an object containing any contextual information. The values should be serializable (i.e. no complex instance objects).\n\n#### logEventWithName()\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.analytics.logEventWithName(\"launch\", {\n  'screen': 'Main screen'\n})\n.then(res => console.log('Sent event named launch'))\n.catch(err => console.error('You should never end up here'));\n```\n\n### Storage\n\nFirebase's integration with the Google platform expanded it's features to include hosting user-generated files, like photos. Firestack provides a thin layer to handle uploading files to Firebase's storage service.\n\n#### setStorageUrl()\n\nIn order to store anything on Firebase, we need to set the storage url provided by Firebase. This can be set by using the `setStorageUrl()` method. Your storageUrl can be found on the firebase console.\n\n![Storage url](http://d.pr/i/1lKjQ.png)\n\nThe `setStorageUrl()` method accepts a single parameter: your root storage url (without leading \"gs://\").\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.storage.setStorageUrl(`${config.firebase.storageBucket}`)\n```\n\nIf the `storageBucket` key is passed as a configuration option, this method is automatically called by default.\n\n#### uploadFile()\n\nWe can upload a file using the `uploadFile()` method. Using the `uploadFile()` method, we can set the name of the destination file, the path where we want to store it, as well as any metadata along with the file.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.storage.uploadFile(`photos/${auth.user.uid}/${filename}`, path, {\n  contentType: 'image/jpeg',\n  contentEncoding: 'base64',\n})\n.then((res) => console.log('The file has been uploaded'))\n.catch(err => console.error('There was an error uploading the file', err))\n```\n\nTo upload camera photos, we can combine this method with the `react-native-camera` plugin, for instance:\n\n```javascript\nthis.camera.capture()\n.then(({path}) => {\n  firestack.storage.uploadFile(`photos/${auth.user.uid}/${filename}`, path, {\n    contentType: 'image/jpeg',\n    contentEncoding: 'base64',\n  })\n})\n.catch(err => console.error(err));\n```\n\nTo combine the `react-native-camera` plugin with firestack, we recommend setting the `captureTarget` to the `temp` storage path, like so:\n\n```javascript\n<Camera\n  ref={(cam) => {\n    this.camera = cam;\n  }}\n  captureTarget={Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.temp}\n  style={styles.preview}\n  aspect={Camera.constants.Aspect.fill}>\n    <Text style={styles.capture} onPress={this.takePicture.bind(this)}>[CAPTURE]</Text>\n</Camera>\n```\n\nFirestack also gives you the ability to listen for database events on upload. The final parameter the `uploadFile()` function accepts is a callback that will be called anytime a storage event is fired.\n\nThe following events are supported:\n\n* upload_progress\n* upload_paused\n* upload_resumed\n\nFor example, the `takePicture` function from the example above might look something similar to:\n\n```javascript\ntakePicture() {\n  this.camera.capture()\n    .then(({path}) => {\n      const filename = 'photo.jpg'\n      firestack.storage.uploadFile(`photos/${filename}`, path, {\n        contentType: 'image/jpeg',\n        contentEncoding: 'base64',\n      }, (evt) => {\n        console.log('Got an event in JS', evt);\n      })\n      .then((res) => {\n        console.log('result from upload file: ', res);\n      })\n      .catch((err) => {\n        console.log('error happened with uploadFile', err);\n      })\n    })\n    .catch(err => console.error(err));\n}\n```\n\n#### downloadUrl()\n\nThe `downloadUrl()` method allows us to fetch the URL from the storage obejct in Firebase. It's defined on the `storageRef` object and can be used like so:\n\n```javascript\nconst storageRef = data.firestack.storage.ref('photos/photo.jpg');\nstorageRef.downloadUrl()\n.then(res => {\n  // res is an object that contains\n  // the `url` as well as the path to the file in `path`\n})\n```\n\n#### download()\n\nIt's possible to download remote files as well. The `download()` method will take a remote file and download and save it to the user's device. It is implemented on the `storageRef`:\n\n```javascript\nconst storageRef = data.firestack.storage.ref('photos/photo.jpg');\nconst localPath = `downloadedFile.jpg`;\nstorageRef.download(localPath, (msg) => {\n  // downloading state callback\n})\n.then(res => {\n  // res contains details about the downloaded file\n})\n.catch(err => {\n  // error contains any errors in downloading\n});\n```\n\nThe method accepts a callback that gets called with any download events:\n\n* download_progress ({eventName: 'download_progress', progress: float });\n* download_paused ({eventName: 'download_paused'})\n* download_resumed ({eventName: 'download_resumed'})\n\nAs helpful constants, Firestack exports a few storage constants on the `firestack.constants` getter:\n\n* MAIN_BUNDLE_PATH\n* CACHES_DIRECTORY_PATH\n* DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY_PATH\n* EXTERNAL_DIRECTORY_PATH\n* EXTERNAL_STORAGE_DIRECTORY_PATH\n* TEMP_DIRECTORY_PATH\n* LIBRARY_DIRECTORY_PATH\n\nAnd we also export the filetype constants as well:\n\n* FILETYPE_REGULAR\n* FILETYPE_DIRECTORY\n\n> Note: this idea comes almost directory from [react-native-fs](https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs), so we don't claim credit for coming up with this fantastic idea.\n\n### Realtime Database\n\nThe native Firebase JavaScript library provides a featureful realtime database that works out of the box. Firestack provides an attribute to interact with the database without needing to configure the JS library.\n\nRanking strategy\n\nAdd a new record with timestamp using this solution:\n\n```js\nfirebaseApp.database.ref('posts').push().then((res) => {\n let newPostKey = res.key;\n firebaseApp.ServerValue.then(map => {\n   const postData = {\n     name: name,\n     timestamp: map.TIMESTAMP,\n     text: this.state.postText,\n     title: this.state.postTitle,\n     puid: newPostKey\n    }\n    let updates = {}\n    updates['/posts/' + newPostKey] = postData\n    firebaseApp.database.ref().update(updates).then(() => {\n      this.setState({\n                      postStatus: 'Posted! Thank You.',\n                      postText: '',\n                    });\n    }).catch(() => {\n      this.setState({ postStatus: 'Something went wrong!!!' });\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nThen retrieve the feed using this:\n\n```js\nfirebaseApp.database.ref('posts').orderByChild('timestamp').limitToLast(30).once('value')\n.then((snapshot) => {\n  this.props.savePosts(snapshot.val())\n  const val = snapshot.val();\n  console.log(val);\n})\n```\n\n#### DatabaseRef\n\nFirestack attempts to provide the same API as the JS Firebase library for both Android and iOS platforms. [Check out the firebase guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write) for more information on how to use the JS library.\n\n#### Example\n\n```javascript\n\nfunction handleValueChange(snapshot) {\n  if (snapshot.val()) {\n    console.log('The list was updated');\n  }\n}\n\nconst LIST_KEY = 'path/to/data';\nfirestack.database.ref(LIST_KEY).on('value', handleValueChange);\n\n// Calling `.off` with a reference to the callback function will only remove that specific listener.\n// This is useful if multiple components are listening and unlistening to the same ref path.\nfirestack.database.ref(LIST_KEY).off('value', handleValueChange);\n\n// Calling `.off` without passing the callback function will remove *all* 'value' listeners for that ref\nfirestack.database.ref(LIST_KEY).off('value');\n\n```\n\n// TODO: Finish documenting\n\n#### Offline data persistence\n\nFor handling offline operations, you can enable persistence by using the `setPersistence()` command. You can turn it on and off by passing the boolean of `true` or `false`.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.database.setPersistence(true);\n```\n\nThe database refs has a `keepSynced()` function to tell the firestack library to keep the data at the `ref` in sync.\n\n```javascript\nconst ref = firestack.database\n            .ref('chat-messages')\n            .child('roomId');\nref.keepSynced(true);\n```\n\n### Presence\n\nFirestack comes in with a built-in method for handling user connections. We just need to set the presence ref url and tell Firestack to keep track of the user by their child path.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.presence          // the presence api\n  .on('users/connections')  // set the users/connections as the\n                            // root for presence handling\n  .setOnline('auser')       // Set the child of auser as online\n```\n\nWhile the _device_ is online (the connection), the value of the child object at `users/connections/auser` will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  online: true,\n  lastOnline: TIMESTAMP\n}\n```\n\nWhen the device is offline, the value will be updated with `online: false`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  online: false,\n  lastOnline: TIMESTAMP\n}\n```\n\nTo set up your own handlers on the presence object, you can call `onConnect()` and pass a callback. The method will be called with the `connectedDevice` database reference and you can set up your own handlers:\n\n```javascript\nconst presence = firestack.presence\n                          .on('users/connections');\npresence.onConnect((ref) => {\n  ref.onDisconnect().remove(); // Remove the entry\n  // or\n  ref.set({\n    location: someLocation\n  });\n  // or whatever you want as it's called with the database\n  // reference. All methods on the DatabaseRef object are\n  // available here on the `ref`\n})\n```\n\n### ServerValue\n\nFirebase provides some static values based upon the server. We can use the `ServerValue` constant to retrieve these. For instance, to grab the TIMESTAMP on the server, use the `TIMESTAMP` value:\n\n```javascript\nconst timestamp = firestack.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP\n```\n\n### Cloud Messaging\n\nAccess the device registration token\n\n```javascript\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.getToken().then(function (token) {\n    console.log('device token', token);\n  });\n```\n\nMonitor token generation\n\n```javascript\n  // add listener\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.listenForTokenRefresh(function (token) {\n    console.log('refresh device token', token);\n  });\n\n  // remove listener\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.unlistenForTokenRefresh();\n```\n\nSubscribe to topic\n\n```javascript\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.subscribeToTopic(\"topic_name\").then(function (topic) {\n      console.log('Subscribe:'+topic);\n  }).catch(function(err){\n       console.error(err);\n  });\n```\n\nUnsubscribe from topic\n\n```javascript\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.unsubscribeFromTopic(\"topic_name\").then(function (topic) {\n      console.log('unsubscribe:'+topic);\n  }).catch(function(err){\n       console.error(err);\n  });\n```\n\nReceive Messages\n\n```javascript\n  firestack.cloudMessaging.listenForReceiveNotification((msg) =>{\n    console.log('Receive Messages:'+msg.data);\n    console.log('Receive Messages:'+msg.notification);\n\n  });\n```\n\n### Events\n\n#### on()\n\nWe can listen to arbitrary events fired by the Firebase library using the `on()` method. The `on()` method accepts a name and a function callback:\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.on('listenForAuth', (evt) => console.log('Got an event'));\n```\n\n#### off()\n\nTo unsubscribe to events fired by Firebase, we can call the `off()` method with the name of the event we want to unsubscribe.\n\n```javascript\nfirestack.off('listenForAuth');\n```\n\n## FirestackModule\n\nFirestack provides a built-in way to connect your Redux app using the `FirestackModule` export from Firestack.\n\n## Running with the `master` branch\n\nMost of our work is committed to the master branch. If you want to run the bleeding-edge version of Firestack, you'll need to follow these instructions.\n\nSince `react-native` doesn't like symlinks, we need to clone the raw repository into our `node_modules/` manually. First, in order to tell `react-native` we are using the package `react-native-firestack`, make sure to install the `npm` version:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save react-native-firestack\n```\n\nAfter the `npm` version is installed, you can either clone the repo directly into our `node_modules/` directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-firestack.git ./node_modules/react-native-firestack\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can clone the repo somewhere else and `rsync` the directory over to the `node_modules/` directory.\n\n> This is the method I use as it allows me to separate the codebases:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-firestack.git \\\n      ~/Development/react-native/mine/react-native-firestack/\n\n## And rsync\nrsync -avhW --delete \\\n      --exclude='node_modules' \\\n      --exclude='.git' \\\n      ~/Development/react-native/mine/react-native-firestack/ \\\n      ./node_modules/react-native-firestack/\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is _open-source_ software and we can make it rock for everyone through contributions.\n\nHow do you contribute? Check out our contribution guide at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fullstackreact/react-native-firestack/blob/master/Contributing.md)\n\n## TODO\n\nThe following is left to be done:\n\n- [x] Complete FirebaseModule functionality\n- [ ] Document FirebaseModule\n- [X] Add Android support\n  - auth/analytics/database/storage/presence are feature-complete. remoteconfig/messaging are mostly-there.\n- [x] Add Cloud Messaging\n  - [ ] Add JS api\n- [ ] Move to use swift (cleaner syntax)\n- [ ] TODO: Finish Facebook integration\n\n# Fullstack React Book\n\n<a href=\"https://fullstackreact.com\">\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/fullstackreact/react-yelp-clone/master/resources/readme/fullstack-react-hero-book.png\" alt=\"Fullstack React Book\" width=\"155\" height=\"250\" />\n</a>\n\nThis repo was written and is maintained by the [Fullstack React](https://fullstackreact.com) team.\n\nIf you're looking to learn React, there's no faster way than by spending a few hours with the [Fullstack React book](https://fullstackreact.com).\n\n<div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\n"

More topics/material will be added as I learn, or as folks [contribute](#contributing).\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Why Secure Your Server\n\nI assume you're using this guide because you, hopefully, already understand why good security is important. That is a heavy topic onto itself and breaking it down is out-of-scope for this guide. If you don't know the answer to that question, I advise you research it first.\n\nAt a high level, the second a  device, like a server, is in the public domain -- i.e visible to the outside world -- it becomes a target for bad-actors. An unsecured device is a playground for bad-actors who want access to your data, or to use your server as another node for their large-scale DDOS attacks.\n\nWhat's worse is, without good security, you may never know if your server has been compromised. A bad-actor may have gained unauthorized access to your server and copied your data without changing anything so you'd never know. Or your server may have been part of a DDOS attack and you wouldn't know. Look at many of the large scale data breaches in the news -- the companies often did not discover the data leak or intrusion until long after the bad-actors were gone.\n\nContrary to popular belief, bad-actors don't always want to change something or [lock you out of your data for money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware). Sometimes they just want the data on your server for their data warehouses (there is big money in big data) or to covertly use your server for their nefarious purposes.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Why Yet Another Guide\n\nThis guide may appear duplicative/unnecessary because there are countless articles online that tell you [how to secure Linux](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+secure+linux&t=ffab&atb=v151-7&ia=web), but the information is spread across different articles, that cover different things, and in different ways. Who has time to scour through hundreds of articles?\n\nAs I was going through research for my Debian build, I kept notes. At the end I realized that, along with what I already knew, and what I was learning, I had the makings of a how-to guide. I figured I'd put it online to hopefully help others **learn**, and **save time**.\n\nI've never found one guide that covers everything -- this guide is my attempt.\n\nMany of the things covered in this guide may be rather basic/trivial, but most of us do not install Linux every day and it is easy to forget those basic things.\n\nIT automation tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), etc. help with the tedious task of installing/configuring a server but IMHO they are better suited for multiple or large scale deployments. IMHO, the overhead required to use those kinds of automation tools is wholly unnecessary for a one-time single server install for home use.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Other Guides\n\nThere are many guides provided by experts, industry leaders, and the distributions themselves. It is not practical, and sometimes against copyright, to include everything from those guides. I recommend you check them out before starting with this guide.\n\n- The [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) provides [benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) that are exhaustive, industry trusted, step-by-step instructions for securing many flavors of Linux. Check their [About Us](https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/) page for details. My recommendation is to go through this guide first and then CIS's guide.

All of the concepts/recommendations here apply to larger/professional environments but those use-cases call for more advanced and specialized configurations that are out-of-scope for this guide.\n- ...**does not** teach you about Linux, how to [install Linux](#installing-linux), or how to use it. Check https://linuxjourney.com/ if you're new to Linux.\n- ...**is** meant to be [Linux distribution agnostic](#picking-a-linux-distribution).\n- ...**does not** teach you everything you need to know about security nor does it get into all aspects of system/server security. For example, physical security is out of scope for this guide.\n- ...**does not** talk about how programs/tools work, nor does it delve into their nook and crannies. Most of the programs/tools this guide references are very powerful and highly configurable. The goal is to cover the bare necessities -- enough to whet your appetite and make you hungry enough to want to go and learn more.\n- ...**aims** to make it easy by providing code you can copy-and-paste. You might need to modify the commands before you paste so keep your favorite [text editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) handy.\n- ...**is** organized in an order that makes logical sense to me -- i.e. securing SSH before installing a firewall. As such, this guide is intended to be followed in the order it is presented but it is not necessary to do so. Just be careful if you do things in a different order -- some sections require previous sections to be completed.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### My Use-Case\n\nThere are many types of servers and different use-cases. While I want this guide to be as generic as possible, there will be some things that may not apply to all/other use-cases. Use your best judgement when going through this guide.\n\nTo help put context to many of the topics covered in this guide, my use-case/configuration is:\n\n- A desktop class computer...\n- With a single NIC...\n- Connected to a consumer grade router...\n- Getting a dynamic WAN IP provided by the ISP...\n- With WAN+LAN on IPV4...\n- And LAN using [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)...\n- That I want to be able to SSH to remotely from unknown computers and unknown locations (i.e. a friend's house).\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Editing Configuration Files - For The Lazy\n\nI am very lazy and do not like to edit files by hand if I don't need to. I also assume everyone else is just like me. :)\n\nSo, when and where possible, I have provided `code` snippets to quickly do what is needed, like add or change a line in a configuration file.\n\nThe `code` snippets use basic commands like `echo`, `cat`, `sed`, `awk`, and `grep`. How the `code` snippets work, like what each command/part does, is out of scope for this guide -- the `man` pages are your friend.\n\n**Note**: The `code` snippets do not validate/verify the change went through -- i.e. the line was actually added or changed. I'll leave the verifying part in your capable hands. The steps in this guide do include taking backups of all files that will be changed.\n\nNot all changes can be automated with `code` snippets. Those changes need good, old fashioned, manual editing. For example, you can't just append a line to an [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) type file. Use your [favorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) Linux text editor.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Contributing\n\nI wanted to put this guide on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) to make it easy to collaborate. The more folks that contribute, the better and more complete this guide will become.\n\nTo contribute you can fork and submit a pull request or submit a [new issue](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/new).\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n## Before You Start\n\n### Identify Your Principles\n\nBefore you start you will want to identify what your Principles are. What is your [threat model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model)? Some things to think about:\n\n- Why do you want to secure your server?\n- How much security do you want or not want?\n- How much convenience are you willing to compromise for security and vice-versa?\n- What are the threats you want to protect against? What are the specifics to your situation? For example:\n  - Is physical access to your server/network a possible attack vector?\n  - Will you be opening ports on your router so you can access your server from outside your home?\n  - Will you be hosting a file share on your server that will be mounted on a desktop class machine? What is the possibility of the desktop machine getting infected and, in turn, infecting the server?\n - Do you have a means of recovering if your security implementation locks you out of your own server? For example, you [disabled root login](#disable-root-login) or [password protected GRUB](#password-protect-grub).\n\nThese are just **a few things** to think about. Before you start securing your server you will want to understand what you're trying to protect against and why so you know what you need to do.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Picking A Linux Distribution\n\nThis guide is intended to be distribution agnostic so users can use [any distribution](https://distrowatch.com/) they want. With that said, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nYou want a distribution that...\n\n- ...**is stable**. Unless you like debugging issues at 2 AM, you don't want an [unattended upgrade](#automatic-security-updates-and-alerts), or a manual package/system update, to render your server inoperable. But this also means you're okay with not running the latest, greatest, bleeding edge software.\n- ...**stays up-to-date with security patches**. You can secure everything on your server, but if the core OS or applications you're running have known vulnerabilities, you'll never be safe.\n- ...**you're familiar with.** If you don't know Linux, I would advise you play around with one before you try to secure it. You should be comfortable with it and know your way around, like how to install software, where configuration files are, etc...\n- ...**is well supported.** Even the most seasoned admin needs help every now and then. Having a place to go for help will save your sanity.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Installing Linux\n\nInstalling Linux is out-of-scope for this guide because each distribution does it differently and the installation instructions are usually well documented. If you need help, start with your distribution's documentation. Regardless of the distribution, the high-level process usually goes like so:\n\n1. download the ISO\n1. burn/copy/transfer it to your install medium (e.g. a CD or USB stick)\n1. boot your server from your install medium\n1. follow the prompts to install\n\nWhere applicable, use the expert install option so you have tighter control of what is running on your server. **Only install what you absolutely need.** I, personally, do not install anything other than SSH. Also, tick the Disk Encryption option.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Pre/Post Installation Requirements\n\n- If you're opening ports on your router so you can access your server from the outside, disable the port forwarding until your system is up and secured.\n- Unless you're doing everything physically connected to your server, you'll need remote access so be sure SSH works.\n- Keep your system up-to-date (i.e. `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` on Debian based systems).\n- Make sure you perform any tasks specific to your setup like:\n  - Configuring network\n  - Configuring mount points in `/etc/fstab`\n  - Creating the initial user accounts\n  - Installing core software you'll want like `man`\n  - Etc...\n- Your server will need to be able to send e-mails so you can get important security alerts. If you're not setting up a mail server check [Gmail and Exim4 As MTA With Implicit TLS](#gmail-and-exim4-as-mta-with-implicit-tls).\n- I would also recommend you go through the [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) before you start with this guide.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Other Important Notes\n\n- This guide is being written and tested on Debian. Most things below should work on other distributions. If you find something that does not, please [contact me](#contacting-me). The main thing that separates each distribution will be its package management system. Since I use Debian, I will provide the appropriate `apt` commands that should work on all [Debian based distributions](https://www.debian.org/derivatives/). If someone is willing to [provide](#contributing) the respective commands for other distributions, I will add them.\n- File paths and settings also may differ slightly -- check with your distribution's documentation if you have issues.\n- Read the whole guide before you start. Your use-case and/or principals may call for not doing something or for changing the order.\n- Do not **blindly** copy-and-paste without understanding what you're pasting. Some commands will need to be modified for your needs before they'll work -- usernames for example.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n## The SSH Server\n\n### Important Note Before You Make SSH Changes\n\nIt is highly advised you keep a 2nd terminal open to your server **before you make and apply SSH configuration changes**. This way if you lock yourself out of your 1st terminal session, you still have one session connected so you can fix it.\n\nThank you to [Sonnenbrand](https://github.com/Sonnenbrand) for this [idea](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/56).\n\n### SSH Public/Private Keys\n\n#### Why\n\nUsing SSH public/private keys is more secure than using a password. It also makes it easier and faster, to connect to our server because you don't have to enter a password.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nCheck the references below for more details but, at a high level, public/private keys work by using a pair of keys to verify identity.\n\n1. One key, the **public** key, **can only encrypt data**, not decrypt it\n1. The other key, the **private** key, can decrypt the data\n\nFor SSH, a public and private key is created on the client. You want to keep both keys secure, especially the private key. Even though the public key is meant to be public, it is wise to make sure neither keys fall in the wrong hands.\n\nWhen you connect to an SSH server, SSH will look for a public key that matches the client you're connecting from in the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server you're connecting to. Notice the file is in the **home folder** of the ID you're trying to connect to. So, after creating the public key, you need to append it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. One approach is to copy it to a USB stick and physically transfer it to the server. Another approach is to use use [`ssh-copy-id`](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id) to transfer and append the public key.\n\nAfter the keys have been created and the public key has been appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the host, SSH uses the public and private keys to verify identity and then establish a secure connection. How identity is verified is a complicated process but [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-ssh-encryption-and-connection-process) has a very nice write-up of how it works. At a high level, identity is verified by the server encrypting a challenge message with the public key, then sending it to the client. If the client cannot decrypt the challenge message with the private key, the identity can't be verified and a connection will not be established.\n\nThey are considered more secure because you need the private key to establish an SSH connection. If you set [`PasswordAuthentication no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`](#PasswordAuthentication), then SSH won't let you connect without the private key.\n\nYou can also set a pass-phrase for the keys which would require you to enter the key pass-phrase when connecting using public/private keys. Keep in mind doing this means you can't use the key for automation because you'll have no way to send the passphrase in your scripts. `ssh-agent` is a program that is shipped in many Linux distros (and usually already running) that will allow you to hold your unencrypted private key in memory for a configurable duration. Simply run `ssh-add` and it will prompt you for your passphrase. You will not be prompted for your passphrase again until the configurable duration has passed.\n\nWe will be using Ed25519 keys which, according to [https://linux-audit.com/](https://linux-audit.com/using-ed25519-openssh-keys-instead-of-dsa-rsa-ecdsa/):\n\n> It is using an elliptic curve signature scheme, which offers better security than ECDSA and DSA. At the same time, it also has good performance.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- Ed25519 public/private SSH keys:\n  - private key on your client\n  - public key on your server\n\n#### Notes\n\n- You'll need to do this step for every computer and account you'll be connecting to your server from/as.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication\n- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys\n- https://linux-audit.com/using-ed25519-openssh-keys-instead-of-dsa-rsa-ecdsa/\n- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-ssh-encryption-and-connection-process\n- https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_Keys\n- https://www.ssh.com/ssh/copy-id\n- `man ssh-keygen`\n- `man ssh-copy-id`\n- `man ssh-add`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. From the computer you're going to use to connect to your server, **the client**, not the server itself, create an [Ed25519](https://linux-audit.com/using-ed25519-openssh-keys-instead-of-dsa-rsa-ecdsa/) key with `ssh-keygen`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    ssh-keygen -t ed25519\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.\n    > Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):\n    > Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.\n    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\n    > Enter same passphrase again:\n    > Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.\n    > Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.\n    > The key fingerprint is:\n    > SHA256:F44D4dr2zoHqgj0i2iVIHQ32uk/Lx4P+raayEAQjlcs user@client\n    > The key's randomart image is:\n    > +--[ED25519 256]--+\n    > |xxxx  x          |\n    > |o.o +. .         |\n    > | o o oo   .      |\n    > |. E oo . o .     |\n    > | o o. o S o      |\n    > |... .. o o       |\n    > |.+....+ o        |\n    > |+.=++o.B..       |\n    > |+..=**=o=.       |\n    > +----[SHA256]-----+\n    > ```\n\n    **Note**: If you set a passphrase, you'll need to enter it every time you connect to your server using this key, unless you're using `ssh-agent`.\n\n1. Now you need to **append** the public key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` from your client to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your server. Since we're presumable still at home on the LAN, we're probably safe from [MIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks, so we will use `ssh-copy-id` to transfer and append the public key:\n\n    ``` bash\n    ssh-copy-id user@server\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \"/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\"\n    > The authenticity of host 'host (192.168.1.96)' can't be established.\n    > ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:QaDQb/X0XyVlogh87sDXE7MR8YIK7ko4wS5hXjRySJE.\n    > Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n    > /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n    > /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\n    > user@host's password:\n    > \n    > Number of key(s) added: 1\n    > \n    > Now try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'user@host'\"\n    > and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n    > ```\n\nNow would be a good time to [perform any tasks specific to your setup](#prepost-installation-requirements).\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Create SSH Group For AllowGroups\n\n#### Why\n\nTo make it easy to control who can SSH to the server. By using a group, we can quickly add/remove accounts to the group to quickly allow or not allow SSH access to the server.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nWe will use the [AllowGroups option](#AllowGroups) in SSH's configuration file [`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`](#secure-etcsshsshd_config) to tell the SSH server to only allow users to SSH in if they are a member of a certain UNIX group. Anyone not in the group will not be able to SSH in.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- a UNIX group that we'll use in [Secure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`](#secure-etcsshsshd_config) to limit who can SSH to the server\n\n#### Notes\n\n- This is a per-requisite step to support the `AllowGroup` setting set in [Secure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`](#secure-etcsshsshd_config).\n\n#### References\n\n- `man groupadd`\n- `man usermod`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Create a group:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo groupadd sshusers\n    ```\n\n1. Add account(s) to the group:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo usermod -a -G sshusers user1\n    sudo usermod -a -G sshusers user2\n    sudo usermod -a -G sshusers ...\n    ```\n\n    You'll need to do this for every account on your server that needs SSH access.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Secure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n\n#### Why\n\nSSH is a door into your server. This is especially true if you are opening ports on your router so you can SSH to your server from outside your home network. If it is not secured properly, a bad-actor could use it to gain unauthorized access to your system.\n\n#### How It Works\n\n`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is the default configuration file that the SSH server uses. We will use this file to tell what options the SSH server should use.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- a secure SSH configuration\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Make sure you've completed [Create SSH Group For AllowGroups](#create-ssh-group-for-allowgroups) first.\n\n#### References\n\n- Mozilla's OpenSSH guidelines for OpenSSH 6.7+ at https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh#modern-openssh-67\n- https://linux-audit.com/audit-and-harden-your-ssh-configuration/\n- https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sshd_config/\n- https://www.techbrown.com/harden-ssh-secure-linux-vps-server/\n- https://serverfault.com/questions/660160/openssh-difference-between-internal-sftp-and-sftp-server/660325\n- `man sshd_config`\n- Thanks to [than0s](https://github.com/than0s) for [how to find duplicate settings](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/38).\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Make a backup of OpenSSH server's configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and remove comments to make it easier to read:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo sed -i -r -e '/^#|^$/ d' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n    ```\n\n1. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` then find and edit or add these settings that should be applied regardless of your configuration/setup:\n\n    **Note**: SSH does not like duplicate contradicting settings. For example, if you have `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` and then `ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes`, SSH will respect the first one and ignore the second. Your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file may already have some of the settings/lines below. To avoid issues you will need to manually go through your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and address any duplicate contradicting settings. \n\n    ```\n    ########################################################################################################\n    # start settings from https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh#modern-openssh-67 as of 2019-01-01\n    ########################################################################################################\n\n    # Supported HostKey algorithms by order of preference.\n    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\n    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\n    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n\n    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\n\n    Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr\n\n    MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,umac-128@openssh.com\n\n    # LogLevel VERBOSE logs user's key fingerprint on login.

The larger the moduli (key size) the stronger the encryption.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- remove all Diffie-Hellman keys that are less than 3072 bits long\n\n#### References\n\n- Mozilla's OpenSSH guidelines for OpenSSH 6.7+ at https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/openssh#modern-openssh-67\n- https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/key_management\n- `man moduli`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Make a backup of SSH's moduli file `/etc/ssh/moduli`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/ssh/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Remove short moduli:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo awk '$5 >= 3071' /etc/ssh/moduli | sudo tee /etc/ssh/moduli.tmp\n    sudo mv /etc/ssh/moduli.tmp /etc/ssh/moduli\n    ````\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### 2FA/MFA for SSH\n\n#### Why\n\nEven though SSH is a pretty good security guard for your doors and windows, it is still a visible door that bad-actors can see and try to brute-force in. [Fail2ban](#fail2ban-application-intrusion-detection-and-prevention) will monitor for these brute-force attempts but there is no such thing as being too secure. Requiring two factors adds an extra layer of security.\n\nUsing Two Factor Authentication (2FA) / Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) requires anyone entering to have **two** keys to enter which makes it harder for bad actors. The two keys are:\n\n1. Their password\n1. A 6 digit token that changes every 30 seconds\n\nWithout both keys, they won't be able to get in.\n\n#### Why Not\n\nMany folks might find the experience cumbersome or annoying. And, access to your system is dependent on the accompanying authenticator app that generates the code.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nOn Linux, PAM is responsible for authentication. There are four tasks to PAM that you can read about at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM. This section talks about the authentication task.\n\nWhen you log into a server, be it directly from the console or via SSH, the door you came through will send the request to the authentication task of PAM and PAM will ask for and verify your password. You can customize the rules each doors use. For example, you could have one set of rules when logging in directly from the console and another set of rules for when logging in via SSH.\n\nThis section will alter the authentication rules for when logging in via SSH to require both a password and a 6 digit code.\n\nWe will use Google's libpam-google-authenticator PAM module to create and verify a [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) key. https://fastmail.blog/2016/07/22/how-totp-authenticator-apps-work/ and https://jemurai.com/2018/10/11/how-it-works-totp-based-mfa/ have very good writeups of how TOTP works.\n\nWhat we will do is tell the server's SSH PAM configuration to ask the user for their password and then their numeric token. PAM will then verify the user's password and, if it is correct, then it will route the authentication request to libpam-google-authenticator which will ask for and verify your 6 digit token. If, and only if, everything is good will the authentication succeed and user be allowed to log in.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- 2FA/MFA enabled for all SSH connections\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Before you do this, you should have an idea of how 2FA/MFA works and you'll need an authenticator app on your phone to continue.\n- We'll use [google-authenticator-libpam](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam).\n- With the below configuration, a user will only need to enter their 2FA/MFA code if they are logging on with their password but **not** if they are using [SSH public/private keys](#ssh-publicprivate-keys). Check the documentation on how to change this behavior to suite your requirements.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm\n- https://fastmail.blog/2016/07/22/how-totp-authenticator-apps-work/\n- https://jemurai.com/2018/10/11/how-it-works-totp-based-mfa/\n\n#### Steps\n\n1.

Thanks to [sbrl](https://github.com/sbrl) for sharing.\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Create a group:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo groupadd sudousers\n    ```\n\n1. Add account(s) to the group:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo usermod -a -G sudousers user1\n    sudo usermod -a -G sudousers user2\n    sudo usermod -a -G sudousers  ...\n    ```\n\n    You'll need to do this for every account on your server that needs sudo privileges.\n\n1. Make a backup of the sudo's configuration file `/etc/sudoers`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Edit sudo's configuration file `/etc/sudoers`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo visudo\n    ```\n\n1. Tell sudo to only allow users in the `sudousers` group to use sudo by adding this line if it is not already there:\n\n    ```\n    %sudousers   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n    ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Limit Who Can Use su\n\n#### Why\n\nsu also lets accounts run commands as other accounts, including **root**.

Allow an application (installed in `/usr/bin` or `/bin`) to run only in a sandbox (see few examples below here):\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/google-chrome-stable\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/firefox\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/chromium\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/evolution\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/thunderbird\n    ```\n\n3. Run the application as usual (via terminal or launcher) and check if is running in a jail:\n\n    ``` bash\n    firejail --list\n    ```\n\n4. Allow a sandboxed app to run again as it was before (example: firefox)\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/firefox\n    ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### NTP Client\n\n#### Why\n\nMany security protocols leverage the time. If your system time is incorrect, it could have negative impacts to your server. An NTP client can solve that problem by keeping your system time in-sync with [global NTP servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)\n\n#### How It Works\n\nNTP stands for Network Time Protocol. In the context of this guide, an NTP client on the server is used to update the server time with the official time pulled from official servers. Check https://www.pool.ntp.org/en/ for all of the public NTP servers.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- NTP client installed and keeping server time in-sync\n\n#### References\n\n- https://cloudpro.zone/index.php/2018/01/27/debian-9-3-server-setup-guide-part-4/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol\n- https://www.pool.ntp.org/en/\n- https://serverfault.com/questions/957302/securing-hardening-ntp-client-on-linux-servers-config-file/957450#957450\n- https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install ntp.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install ntp\n    ```\n    \n1. Make a backup of the NTP client's configuration file `/etc/ntp.conf`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. The default configuration, at least on Debian, is already pretty secure. The only thing we'll want to make sure is we're the `pool` directive and not any `server` directives. The `pool` directive allows the NTP client to stop using a server if it is unresponsive or serving bad time. Do this by commenting out all `server` directives and adding the below to `/etc/ntp.conf`.\n\t\n    ```\n    pool pool.ntp.org iburst\n    ```\n    \n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n    \n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e \"s/^((server|pool).*)/# \\1         # commented by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")/\" /etc/ntp.conf\n    echo -e \"\\npool pool.ntp.org iburst         # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ntp.conf\n    ```\n\n    **Example `/etc/ntp.conf`**:\n    \n    > ```\n    > driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift\n    > statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats\n    > filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable\n    > filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable\n    > filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable\n    > restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited\n    > restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited\n    > restrict 127.0.0.1\n    > restrict ::1\n    > restrict source notrap nomodify noquery\n    > pool pool.ntp.org iburst         # added by user on 2019-03-09 @ 10:23:35\n    > ```\n    \n1.

Many of them are just numbers, which represent the information about a particular process ID (PID). By default, Linux systems are deployed to allow all local users to see this all information. This includes process information from other users. This could include sensitive details that you may not want to share with other users. By applying some filesystem configuration tweaks, we can change this behavior and improve the security of the system.\n\n**Note**: This may break on some `systemd` systems.

[pwquality](https://linux.die.net/man/5/pwquality.conf)/[pam_pwquality](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_pwquality) addresses this security gap by providing \"a way to configure the default password quality requirements for the system passwords\" and checking \"its strength against a system dictionary and a set of rules for identifying poor choices.\"\n\n#### How It Works\n\nOn Linux, PAM is responsible for authentication. There are four tasks to PAM that you can read about at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM. This section talks about the password task.\n\nWhen there is a need to set or change an account password, the password task of PAM handles the request. In this section we will tell PAM's password task to pass the requested new password to libpam-pwquality to make sure it meets our requirements. If the requirements are met it is used/set; if it does not meet the requirements it errors and lets the user know.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- enforced strong passwords\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install libpam-pwquality.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install libpam-pwquality\n    ```\n\n1. Make a backup of PAM's password configuration file `/etc/pam.d/common-password`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-password-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Tell PAM to use libpam-pwquality to enforce strong passwords by editing the file `/etc/pam.d/common-password` and change the line that starts like this:\n\n    ```\n    password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so\n    ```\n\n    to this:\n\n    ```\n    password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 gecoschec\n    ```\n\n   The above options are:\n\n     - `retry=3` = prompt user 3 times before returning with error.\n     - `minlen=10` = the minimum length of the password, factoring in any credits (or debits) from these:\n       - `dcredit=-1` = must have at least **one digit**\n       - `ucredit=-1` = must have at least **one upper case letter**\n       - `lcredit=-1` = must have at least **one lower case letter**\n       - `ocredit=-1` = must have at least **one non-alphanumeric character**\n     - `difok=3` = at least 3 characters from the new password cannot have been in the old password\n     - `maxrepeat=3` = allow a maximum of 3 repeated characters\n     - `gecoschec` = do not allow passwords with the account's name\n\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n    \n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e \"s/^(password\\s+requisite\\s+pam_pwquality.so)(.*)$/# \\1\\2         # commented by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\\n\\1 retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 gecoschec         # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")/\" /etc/pam.d/common-password\n    ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Automatic Security Updates and Alerts\n\n#### Why\n\nIt is important to keep a server updated with the latest **critical security patches and updates**. Otherwise you're at risk of known security vulnerabilities that bad-actors could use to gain unauthorized access to your server.\n\nUnless you plan on checking your server every day, you'll want a way to automatically update the system and/or get emails about available updates.\n\nYou don't want to do all updates because with every update there is a risk of something breaking. It is important to do the critical updates but everything else can wait until you have time to do it manually.\n\n#### Why Not\n\nAutomatic and unattended updates may break your system and you may not be near your server to fix it. This would be especially problematic if it broke your SSH access.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Each distribution manages packages and updates differently. So far I only have steps for Debian based systems.\n- Your server will need a way to send e-mails for this to work\n\n#### Goals\n\n- Automatic, unattended, updates of critical security patches\n- Automatic emails of remaining pending updates\n\n#### Debian Based Systems\n\n##### How It Works\n\nOn Debian based systems you can use:\n\n- unattended-upgrades to automatically do system updates you want (i.e. critical security updates)\n- apt-listchanges to get details about package changes before they are installed/upgraded\n- apticron to get emails for pending package updates\n\nWe will use unattended-upgrades to apply **critical security patches**. We can also apply stable updates since they've already been thoroughly tested by the Debian community.\n\n##### References\n\n- https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades\n- https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.regular-upgrades.html\n- https://blog.sleeplessbeastie.eu/2015/01/02/how-to-perform-unattended-upgrades/\n- https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-set-up-unattended-upgrades-on-debian-9-stretch\n- https://github.com/mvo5/unattended-upgrades\n- https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades#apt-listchanges\n- https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apt-get-apticron-send-email-upgrades-available/\n- https://www.unixmen.com/how-to-get-email-notifications-for-new-updates-on-debianubuntu/\n- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`\n\n##### Steps\n\n1. Install unattended-upgrades, apt-listchanges, and apticron:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges apticron\n    ```\n\n1. Now we need to configure unattended-upgrades to automatically apply the updates. This is typically done by editing the files `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` and `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` that were created by the packages. However, because these file may get overwritten with a future update, we'll create a new file instead. Create the file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51myunattended-upgrades` and add this:\n\n    ```\n    // Enable the update/upgrade script (0=disable)\n    APT::Periodic::Enable \"1\";\n\n    // Do \"apt-get update\" automatically every n-days (0=disable)\n    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"1\";\n\n    // Do \"apt-get upgrade --download-only\" every n-days (0=disable)\n    APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages \"1\";\n\n    // Do \"apt-get autoclean\" every n-days (0=disable)\n    APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval \"7\";\n\n    // Send report mail to root\n    //     0:  no report             (or null string)\n    //     1:  progress report       (actually any string)\n    //     2:  + command outputs     (remove -qq, remove 2>/dev/null, add -d)\n    //     3:  + trace on    APT::Periodic::Verbose \"2\";\n    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"1\";\n\n    // Automatically upgrade packages from these\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern {\n          \"o=Debian,a=stable\";\n          \"o=Debian,a=stable-updates\";\n          \"origin=Debian,codename=${distro_codename},label=Debian-Security\";\n    };\n\n    // You can specify your own packages to NOT automatically upgrade here\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {\n    };\n\n    // Run dpkg --force-confold --configure -a if a unclean dpkg state is detected to true to ensure that updates get installed even when the system got interrupted during a previous run\n    Unattended-Upgrade::AutoFixInterruptedDpkg \"true\";\n\n    //Perform the upgrade when the machine is running because we wont be shutting our server down often\n    Unattended-Upgrade::InstallOnShutdown \"false\";\n\n    // Send an email to this address with information about the packages upgraded.\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Mail \"root\";\n\n    // Always send an e-mail\n    Unattended-Upgrade::MailOnlyOnError \"false\";\n\n    // Remove all unused dependencies after the upgrade has finished\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n\n    // Remove any new unused dependencies after the upgrade has finished\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-New-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n\n    // Automatically reboot WITHOUT CONFIRMATION if the file /var/run/reboot-required is found after the upgrade.\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot \"true\";\n\n    // Automatically reboot even if users are logged in.\n    Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot-WithUsers \"true\";\n    ```\n\n    **Notes**:\n    - Check `/usr/lib/apt/apt.systemd.daily` for details on the `APT::Periodic` options\n    - Check https://github.com/mvo5/unattended-upgrades for details on the `Unattended-Upgrade` options\n\n1. Run a dry-run of unattended-upgrades to make sure your configuration file is okay:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo unattended-upgrade -d --dry-run\n    ```\n\n    If everything is okay, you can let it run whenever it's scheduled to or force a run with `unattended-upgrade -d`.\n\n1. Configure apt-listchanges to your liking:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo dpkg-reconfigure apt-listchanges\n    ```\n\n1. For apticron, the default settings are good enough but you can check them in `/etc/apticron/apticron.conf` if you want to change them. For example, my configuration looks like this:\n\n    > ```\n    > EMAIL=\"root\"\n    > NOTIFY_NO_UPDATES=\"1\"\n    > ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### More Secure Random Entropy Pool (WIP)\n\n#### Why\n\nWIP\n\n#### How It Works\n\nWIP\n\n#### Goals\n\nWIP\n\n#### References\n\n- Thanks to [branneman](https://github.com/branneman) for this idea as submitted in [issue #33](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/33).\n- https://hackaday.com/2017/11/02/what-is-entropy-and-how-do-i-get-more-of-it/\n- https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom\n- https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/tlecarrour/rng-tools.html\n- https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rng-tools\n- https://www.howtoforge.com/helping-the-random-number-generator-to-gain-enough-entropy-with-rng-tools-debian-lenny\n- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/sect-security_guide-encryption-using_the_random_number_generator\n\n#### Steps\n\n1.

Why would my server be sending traffic out that I don't know about? And why would external traffic be trying to access my server if I don't know who or what it is? When it comes to good security, my opinion is to reject/deny by default, and allow by exception.\n\nOf course, if you disagree, that is totally fine and can configure UFW to suit your needs.\n\nEither way, ensuring that only traffic we explicitly allow is the job of a firewall.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nThe Linux kernel provides capabilities to monitor and control network traffic. These capabilities are exposed to the end-user through firewall utilities. On Linux, the most common firewall is [iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables). However, iptables is rather complicated and confusing (IMHO). This is where UFW comes in. Think of UFW as a front-end to iptables. It simplifies the process of managing the iptables rules that tell the Linux kernel what to do with network traffic.\n\n**UFW** works by letting you configure rules that:\n\n- **allow** or **deny**\n- **input** or **output** traffic\n- **to** or **from** ports\n\nYou can create rules by explicitly specifying the ports or with application configurations that specify the ports.\n\n#### Goals\n\n - all network traffic, input and output, blocked except those we explicitly allow\n\n#### Notes\n\n- As you install other programs, you'll need to enable the necessary ports/applications.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://launchpad.net/ufw\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install ufw.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install ufw\n    ```\n\n1. Deny all outgoing traffic:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw default deny outgoing comment 'deny all outgoing traffic'\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Default outgoing policy changed to 'deny'\n    > (be sure to update your rules accordingly)\n    > ```\n\n    If you are not as paranoid as me, and don't want to deny all outgoing traffic, you can allow it instead:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw default allow outgoing comment 'allow all outgoing traffic'\n    ```\n\n1. Deny all incoming traffic:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw default deny incoming comment 'deny all incoming traffic'\n    ```\n\n1. Obviously we want SSH connections in:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw limit in ssh comment 'allow SSH connections in'\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Rules updated\n    > Rules updated (v6)\n    > ```\n\n1. Allow additional traffic as per your needs. Some common use-cases:\n\n    ``` bash\n    # allow traffic out on port 53 -- DNS\n    sudo ufw allow out 53 comment 'allow DNS calls out'\n\t\n\t# allow traffic out on port 123 -- NTP\n    sudo ufw allow out 123 comment 'allow NTP out'\n\n    # allow traffic out for HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP\n    # apt might needs these depending on which sources you're using\n    sudo ufw allow out http comment 'allow HTTP traffic out'\n    sudo ufw allow out https comment 'allow HTTPS traffic out'\n    sudo ufw allow out ftp comment 'allow FTP traffic out'\n\n    # allow whois\n    sudo ufw allow out whois comment 'allow whois'\n\n    # allow traffic out on port 68 -- the DHCP client\n    # you only need this if you're using DHCP\n    sudo ufw allow out 67 comment 'allow the DHCP client to update'\n    sudo ufw allow out 68 comment 'allow the DHCP client to update'\n    ```\n\n1. Start ufw:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw enable\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y\n    > Firewall is active and enabled on system startup\n    > ```\n\n1.

You can see them with:\n\n``` bash\nsudo ufw app list\n```\n\n> ```\n> Available applications:\n>   AIM\n>   Bonjour\n>   CIFS\n>   DNS\n>   Deluge\n>   IMAP\n>   IMAPS\n>   IPP\n>   KTorrent\n>   Kerberos Admin\n>   Kerberos Full\n>   Kerberos KDC\n>   Kerberos Password\n>   LDAP\n>   LDAPS\n>   LPD\n>   MSN\n>   MSN SSL\n>   Mail submission\n>   NFS\n>   OpenSSH\n>   POP3\n>   POP3S\n>   PeopleNearby\n>   SMTP\n>   SSH\n>   Socks\n>   Telnet\n>   Transmission\n>   Transparent Proxy\n>   VNC\n>   WWW\n>   WWW Cache\n>   WWW Full\n>   WWW Secure\n>   XMPP\n>   Yahoo\n>   qBittorrent\n>   svnserve\n> ```\n\nTo get details about the app, like which ports it includes, type:\n\n``` bash\nsudo ufw app info [app name]\n```\n\n> ``` bash\n> sudo ufw app info DNS\n> ```\n> \n> ```\n> Profile: DNS\n> Title: Internet Domain Name Server\n> Description: Internet Domain Name Server\n> \n> Port:\n>   53\n> ```\n\n#### Custom Application\n\nIf you don't want to create rules by explicitly providing the port number(s), you can create your own application configurations. To do this, create a file in `/etc/ufw/applications.d`.\n\nFor example, here is what you would use for [Plex](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201543147-what-network-ports-do-i-need-to-allow-through-my-firewall/):\n\n``` bash\ncat /etc/ufw/applications.d/plexmediaserver\n```\n\n> ```\n> [PlexMediaServer]\n> title=Plex Media Server\n> description=This opens up PlexMediaServer for http (32400), upnp, and autodiscovery.\n> ports=32469/tcp|32413/udp|1900/udp|32400/tcp|32412/udp|32410/udp|32414/udp|32400/udp\n> ```\n\nThen you can enable it like any other app:\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow plexmediaserver\n```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### iptables Intrusion Detection And Prevention with PSAD\n\n#### Why\n\nEven if you have a firewall to guard your doors, it is possible to try brute-forcing your way in any of the guarded doors. We want to monitor all network activity to detect potential intrusion attempts, such has repeated attempts to get in, and block them.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nI can't explain it any better than user [FINESEC](https://serverfault.com/users/143961/finesec) from https://serverfault.com/ did at: https://serverfault.com/a/447604/289829.\n\n> Fail2BAN scans log files of various applications such as apache, ssh or ftp and automatically bans IPs that show the malicious signs such as automated login attempts. PSAD on the other hand scans iptables and ip6tables log messages (typically /var/log/messages) to detect and optionally block scans and other types of suspect traffic such as DDoS or OS fingerprinting attempts. It's ok to use both programs at the same time because they operate on different level.\n\nAnd, since we're already using [UFW](#ufw-uncomplicated-firewall) so we'll follow the awesome instructions by [netson](https://gist.github.com/netson) at https://gist.github.com/netson/c45b2dc4e835761fbccc to make PSAD work with UFW.\n\n#### References\n\n- http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/\n- http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/docs/config.html\n- https://www.thefanclub.co.za/how-to/how-install-psad-intrusion-detection-ubuntu-1204-lts-server\n- https://serverfault.com/a/447604/289829\n- https://serverfault.com/a/770424/289829\n- https://gist.github.com/netson/c45b2dc4e835761fbccc\n- Thanks to [sysadt](https://github.com/sysadt) for catching the issue ([#61](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/61)) with `psadwatchd`.\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install psad.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install psad\n    ```\n\n1. Make a backup of psad's configuration file `/etc/psad/psad.conf`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/psad/psad.conf /etc/psad/psad.conf-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Review and update configuration options in `/etc/psad/psad.conf`. Pay special attention to these:\n\n   |Setting|Set To\n   |--|--|\n   |[`EMAIL_ADDRESSES`](http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/docs/config.html#EMAIL_ADDRESSES)|your email address(s)|\n   |`HOSTNAME`|your server's hostname|\n   |`ENABLE_PSADWATCHD`|`ENABLE_PSADWATCHD Y;`|\n   |[`ENABLE_AUTO_IDS`](http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/docs/config.html#ENABLE_AUTO_IDS)|`ENABLE_AUTO_IDS Y;`|\n   |`ENABLE_AUTO_IDS_EMAILS`|`ENABLE_AUTO_IDS_EMAILS Y;`|\n   |`EXPECT_TCP_OPTIONS`|`EXPECT_TCP_OPTIONS Y;`|\n\n   Check the configuration file psad's documentation at http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/docs/config.html for more details.\n\n1. <a name=\"psad_step4\"></a>Now we need to make some changes to ufw so it works with psad by telling ufw to log all traffic so psad can analyze it. Do this by editing **two files** and adding these lines **at the end but before the COMMIT line**.\n\n    Make backups:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/ufw/before.rules /etc/ufw/before.rules-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/ufw/before6.rules /etc/ufw/before6.rules-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n    Edit the files:\n\n    - `/etc/ufw/before.rules`\n    - `/etc/ufw/before6.rules`\n\n    And add add this **at the end but before the COMMIT line**:\n\n    ```\n    # log all traffic so psad can analyze\n    -A INPUT -j LOG --log-tcp-options --log-prefix \"[IPTABLES] \"\n    -A FORWARD -j LOG --log-tcp-options --log-prefix \"[IPTABLES] \"\n    ```\n\n    **Note**: We're adding a log prefix to all the iptables logs. We'll need this for [seperating iptables logs to their own file](#ns-separate-iptables-log-file).\n\n    For example:\n\n    > ```\n    > ...\n    > \n    > # log all traffic so psad can analyze\n    > -A INPUT -j LOG --log-tcp-options --log-prefix \"[IPTABLES] \"\n    > -A FORWARD -j LOG --log-tcp-options --log-prefix \"[IPTABLES] \"\n    > \n    > # don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these rules won't be processed\n    > COMMIT\n    > ```\n\n1. Now we need to reload/restart ufw and psad for the changes to take effect:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo ufw reload\n\n    sudo psad -R\n    sudo psad --sig-update\n    sudo psad -H\n    ```\n\n1. Analyze iptables rules for errors:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo psad --fw-analyze\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > [+] Parsing INPUT chain rules.\n    > [+] Parsing INPUT chain rules.\n    > [+] Firewall config looks good.\n    > [+] Completed check of firewall ruleset.\n    > [+] Results in /var/log/psad/fw_check\n    > [+] Exiting.\n    > ```\n\n    **Note**: If there were any issues you will get an e-mail with the error.\n\n1. Check the status of psad:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo psad --Status\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > [-] psad: pid file /var/run/psad/psadwatchd.pid does not exist for psadwatchd on vm\n    > [+] psad_fw_read (pid: 3444)  %CPU: 0.0  %MEM: 2.2\n    >     Running since: Sat Feb 16 01:03:09 2019\n    > \n    > [+] psad (pid: 3435)  %CPU: 0.2  %MEM: 2.7\n    >     Running since: Sat Feb 16 01:03:09 2019\n    >     Command line arguments: [none specified]\n    >     Alert email address(es): root@localhost\n    > \n    > [+] Version: psad v2.4.3\n    > \n    > [+] Top 50 signature matches:\n    >         [NONE]\n    > \n    > [+] Top 25 attackers:\n    >         [NONE]\n    > \n    > [+] Top 20 scanned ports:\n    >         [NONE]\n    > \n    > [+] iptables log prefix counters:\n    >         [NONE]\n    > \n    >     Total protocol packet counters:\n    > \n    > [+] IP Status Detail:\n    >         [NONE]\n    > \n    >     Total scan sources: 0\n    >     Total scan destinations: 0\n    > \n    > [+] These results are available in: /var/log/psad/status.out\n    > ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Application Intrusion Detection And Prevention With Fail2Ban\n\n#### Why\n\nUFW tells your server what doors to board up so nobody can see them, and what doors to allow authorized users through. PSAD monitors network activity to detect and prevent potential intrusions -- repeated attempts to get in. \n\nBut what about the applications/services your server is running, like SSH and Apache, where your firewall is configured to allow access in. Even though access may be allowed that doesn't mean all access attempts are valid and harmless. What if someone tries to brute-force their way in to a web-app you're running on your server? This is where Fail2ban comes in.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nFail2ban monitors the logs of your applications (like SSH and Apache) to detect and prevent potential intrusions. It will monitor network traffic/logs and prevent intrusions by blocking suspicious activity (e.g. multiple successive failed connections in a short time-span).\n\n#### Goals\n\n- network monitoring for suspicious activity with automatic banning of offending IPs\n\n#### Notes\n\n- As of right now, the only thing running on this server is SSH so we'll want Fail2ban to monitor SSH and ban as necessary.\n- As you install other programs, you'll need to create/configure the appropriate jails and enable them.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.fail2ban.org/\n- https://blog.vigilcode.com/2011/05/ufw-with-fail2ban-quick-secure-setup-part-ii/\n- https://dodwell.us/security/ufw-fail2ban-portscan.html\n- https://www.howtoforge.com/community/threads/fail2ban-and-ufw-on-debian.77261/\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install fail2ban.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install fail2ban\n    ```\n\n1. We don't want to edit `/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf` or `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` because a future update may overwrite those so we'll create a local copy instead. Create the file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` and add this to it after replacing `[LAN SEGMENT]` and `[your email]` with the appropriate values:\n\n    ```\n    [DEFAULT]\n    # the IP address range we want to ignore\n    ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 [LAN SEGMENT]\n\n    # who to send e-mail to\n    destemail = [your e-mail]\n\n    # who is the email from\n    sender = [your e-mail]\n\n    # since we're using exim4 to send emails\n    mta = mail\n\n    # get email alerts\n    action = %(action_mwl)s\n    ```\n\n    **Note**: Your server will need to be able to send e-mails so Fail2ban can let you know of suspicious activity and when it banned an IP.\n\n1. We need to create a jail for SSH that tells fail2ban to look at SSH logs and use ufw to ban/unban IPs as needed. Create a jail for SSH by creating the file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh.local` and adding this to it:\n\n    ```\n    [sshd]\n    enabled = true\n    banaction = ufw\n    port = ssh\n    filter = sshd\n    logpath = %(sshd_log)s\n    maxretry = 5\n    ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh.local\n    [sshd]\n    enabled = true\n    banaction = ufw\n    port = ssh\n    filter = sshd\n    logpath = %(sshd_log)s\n    maxretry = 5\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n1. In the above we tell fail2ban to use the ufw as the `banaction`. Fail2ban ships with an action configuration file for ufw. You can see it in `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw.conf`\n\n1. Enable fail2ban:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo fail2ban-client start\n    sudo fail2ban-client reload\n    sudo fail2ban-client add sshd # This may fail on some systems if the sshd jail was added by default\n    ```\n\n1. To check the status:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo fail2ban-client status\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Status\n    > |- Number of jail:      1\n    > `- Jail list:   sshd\n    > ```\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo fail2ban-client status sshd\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > Status for the jail: sshd\n    > |- Filter\n    > |  |- Currently failed: 0\n    > |  |- Total failed:     0\n    > |  `- File list:        /var/log/auth.log\n    > `- Actions\n    >    |- Currently banned: 0\n    >    |- Total banned:     0\n    >    `- Banned IP list:\n    > ```\n\n#### Custom Jails\n\nI have not needed to create a custom jail yet. Once I do, and I figure out how, I will update this guide. Or, if you know how please help [contribute](#contributing).\n\n#### Unban an IP\n\nTo unban an IP use this command:\n\n``` bash\nfail2ban-client set [jail] unbanip [IP]\n```\n\n`[jail]` is the name of the jail that has the banned IP and `[IP]` is the IP address you want to unban. For example, to unaban `192.168.1.100` from SSH you would do:\n\n``` bash\nfail2ban-client set sshd unbanip 192.168.1.100\n```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n## The Auditing\n\n### File/Folder Integrity Monitoring With AIDE (WIP)\n\n#### Why\n\nWIP\n\n#### How It Works\n\nWIP\n\n#### Goals\n\nWIP\n\n#### References\n\n- https://aide.github.io/\n- https://www.hiroom2.com/2017/06/09/debian-8-file-integrity-check-with-aide/\n- https://blog.rapid7.com/2017/06/30/how-to-install-and-configure-aide-on-ubuntu-linux/\n- https://www.stephenrlang.com/2016/03/using-aide-for-file-integrity-monitoring-fim-on-ubuntu/\n- https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-configure-the-aide-advanced-intrusion-detection-environment-file-integrity-scanner-for-your-website\n- https://www.tecmint.com/check-integrity-of-file-and-directory-using-aide-in-linux/\n- https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-linux-software-integrity-checking-with-aide/\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install AIDE.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n    \n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install aide\n    ```\n    \n1. Make a backup of AIDE's defaults file:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp -p /etc/default/aide /etc/default/aide-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Go through `/etc/default/aide` and set AIDE's defaults per your requirements. If you want AIDE to run daily and e-mail you, be sure to set `CRON_DAILY_RUN` to `yes`.\n\n1. Make a backup of AIDE's configuration files:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp -pr /etc/aide /etc/aide-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. On Debian based systems:\n\n    - AIDE's configuration files are in `/etc/aide/aide.conf.d/`.\n    - You'll want to go through AIDE's documentation and the configuration files in to set them per your requirements.\n    - If you want new settings, to monitor a new folder for example, you'll want to add them to `/etc/aide/aide.conf` or `/etc/aide/aide.conf.d/`.\n    - Take a backup of the stock configuration files: `sudo cp -pr /etc/aide /etc/aide-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")`.\n\n1.

That's it. If you set `CRON_DAILY_RUN` to `yes` in `/etc/default/aide` then cron will execute `/etc/cron.daily/aide` every day and e-mail you the output.\n\n#### Updating The Database\n\nEvery time you make changes to files/folders that AIDE monitors, you will need to update the database to capture those changes. To do that on Debian based systems:\n\n``` bash\nsudo aideinit -y -f\n```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Anti-Virus Scanning With ClamAV (WIP)\n\n#### Why\n\nWIP\n\n#### How It Works\n\n- ClamAV is a virus scanner\n- ClamAV-Freshclam is a service that keeps the virus definitions updated\n- ClamAV-Daemon keeps the `clamd` process running to make scanning faster\n\n#### Goals\n\nWIP\n\n#### Notes\n\n- These instructions **do not** tell you how to enable the ClamAV daemon service to ensure `clamd` is running all the time. `clamd` is only if you're running a mail server and does not provide real-time monitoring of files. Instead, you'd want to scan files manually or on a schedule.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.clamav.net/documents/installation-on-debian-and-ubuntu-linux-distributions\n- https://wiki.debian.org/ClamAV\n- https://www.osradar.com/install-clamav-debian-9-ubuntu-18/\n- https://www.lisenet.com/2014/automate-clamav-to-perform-daily-system-scan-and-send-email-notifications-on-linux/\n- https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/configure-clamav-to-scan-and-notify-virus-and-malware/\n- https://serverfault.com/questions/741299/is-there-a-way-to-keep-clamav-updated-on-debian-8\n- https://askubuntu.com/questions/250290/how-do-i-scan-for-viruses-with-clamav\n- https://ngothang.com/how-to-install-clamav-and-configure-daily-scanning-on-centos/\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install ClamAV.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install clamav clamav-freshclam clamav-daemon\n    ```\n\n1. Make a backup of `clamav-freshclam`'s configuration file `/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n    \n1. `clamav-freshclam`'s default settings are probably good enough but if you want to change them, you can either edit the file `/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` or use `dpkg-reconfigure`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo dpkg-reconfigure clamav-freshclam\n    ```\n    \n    **Note**: The default settings will update the definitions 24 times in a day. To change the interval, check the `Checks` setting in `/etc/clamav/freshclam.conf` or use `dpkg-reconfigure`.\n\n1. Start the `clamav-freshclam` service:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo service clamav-freshclam start\n    ```\n    \n1.

Unless you plan on checking your server everyday, you'll want a way to get e-mail summary of your server's logs. To accomplish this we'll use [logwatch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/).\n\n#### How It Works\n\nlogwatch scans system log files and summarizes them. You can run it directly from the command line or schedule it to run on a recurring schedule. logwatch uses service files to know how to read/summarize a log file. You can see all of the stock service files in `/usr/share/logwatch/scripts/services`.\n\nlogwatch's configuration file `/usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf` specifies default options. You can override them via command line arguments.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- Logwatch configured to send a daily e-mail summary of all of the server's status and logs\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Your server will need to be able to send e-mails for this to work\n- The below steps will result in logwatch running every day. If you want to change the schedule, modify the cronjob to your liking. You'll also want to change the `range` option to cover your recurrence window. See https://www.badpenguin.org/configure-logwatch-for-weekly-email-and-html-output-format for an example.\n- If logwatch fails to deliver mail due to the e-mail having long lines please check https://blog.dhampir.no/content/exim4-line-length-in-debian-stretch-mail-delivery-failed-returning-message-to-sender as documented in [issue #29](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/29). If you you followed [Gmail and Exim4 As MTA With Implicit TLS](#gmail-and-exim4-as-mta-with-implicit-tls) then we already took care of this in step #7.\n\n#### References\n\n- Thanks to [amacheema](https://github.com/amacheema) for fixing some issues with the steps and letting me know of a long line bug with exim4 as documented in [issue #29](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/29).\n- https://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/\n- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-logwatch-log-analyzer-and-reporter-on-a-vps\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Install logwatch.\n\n    On Debian based systems:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install logwatch\n    ```\n\n1. To see a sample of what logwatch collects you can run it directly:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo /usr/sbin/logwatch --output stdout --format text --range yesterday --service all\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > \n    >  ################### Logwatch 7.4.3 (12/07/16) ####################\n    >         Processing Initiated: Mon Mar  4 00:05:50 2019\n    >         Date Range Processed: yesterday\n    >                               ( 2019-Mar-03 )\n    >                               Period is day.\n    >         Detail Level of Output: 5\n    >         Type of Output/Format: stdout / text\n    >         Logfiles for Host: host\n    >  ##################################################################\n    > \n    >  --------------------- Cron Begin ------------------------\n    > ...\n    > ...\n    >  ---------------------- Disk Space End -------------------------\n    > \n    > \n    >  ###################### Logwatch End #########################\n    > ```\n\n1. Go through logwatch's self-documented configuration file `/usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf` before continuing. There is no need to change anything here but pay special attention to the `Output`, `Format`, `MailTo`, `Range`, and `Service` as those are the ones we'll be using. For our purposes, instead of specifying our options in the configuration file, we will pass them as command line arguments in the daily cron job that executes logwatch. That way, if the configuration file is ever modified (e.g. during an update), our options will still be there.\n\n1. Make a backup of logwatch's daily cron file `/etc/cron.daily/00logwatch` and unset the execute bit:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo chmod -x /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch-COPY*\n    ```\n\n1. By default, logwatch outputs to `stdout`. Since the goal is to get a daily e-mail, we need to change the output type that logwatch uses to send e-mail instead. We could do this through the configuration file above, but that would apply to every time it is run -- even when we run it manually and want to see the output to the screen. Instead, we'll change the cron job that executes logwatch to send e-mail. This way, when run manually, we'll still get output to `stdout` and when run by cron, it'll send an e-mail. We'll also make sure it checks for all services, and change the output format to html so it's easier to read regardless of what the configuration file says. In the file `/etc/cron.daily/00logwatch` find the execute line and change it to:\n\n    ```\n    /usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --format html --mailto root --range yesterday --service all\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > #!/bin/bash\n    > \n    > #Check if removed-but-not-purged\n    > test -x /usr/share/logwatch/scripts/logwatch.pl || exit 0\n    > \n    > #execute\n    > /usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --format html --mailto root --range yesterday --service all\n    > \n    > #Note: It's possible to force the recipient in above command\n    > #Just pass --mailto address@a.com instead of --output mail\n    > ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n    \n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e \"s,^($(sudo which logwatch).*?),# \\1         # commented by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\\n$(sudo which logwatch) --output mail --format html --mailto root --range yesterday --service all         # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\"),\" /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch\n    ```\n\n1. You can test the cron job by executing it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch\n    ```\n    \n    **Note**: If logwatch fails to deliver mail due to the e-mail having long lines please check https://blog.dhampir.no/content/exim4-line-length-in-debian-stretch-mail-delivery-failed-returning-message-to-sender as documented in [issue #29](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/29).

When you have an application or service (like SSH or Apache) running on your server, they listen for requests on specific ports.\n\nObviously we don't want your server listening on ports we don't know about. We'll use `ss` to see all the ports that services are listening on. This will help us track down and stop rogue, potentially dangerous, services.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- find out non-localhost what ports are open and listening for connections\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/arx7st/howtosecurealinuxserver_an_evolving_howto_guide/egrib6o/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/arx7st/howtosecurealinuxserver_an_evolving_howto_guide/egs1rev/\n- https://www.tecmint.com/find-open-ports-in-linux/\n- `man ss`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1.

PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK !!</summary>\n\n#### Why\n\nThe kernel is the brains of a Linux system. Securing it just makes sense.\n\n#### Why Not\n\nChanging kernel settings with sysctl is risky and could break your server. If you don't know what you are doing, don't have the time to debug issues, or just don't want to take the risks, I would advise from not following these steps.\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nI am not as knowledgeable about hardening/securing a Linux kernel as I'd like. As much as I hate to admit it, I do not know what all of these settings do. My understanding is that most of them are general kernel hardening and performance, and the others are to protect against spoofing and DOS attacks.\n\nIn fact, since I am not 100% sure exactly what each setting does, I took recommended settings from numerous sites (all linked in the references below) and combined them to figure out what should be set. I figure if multiple reputable sites mention the same setting, it's probably safe.\n\nIf you have a better understanding of what these settings do, or have any other feedback/advice on them, please [let me know](#contacting-me).\n\nI won't provide [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy) code in this section.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Documentation on all the sysctl settings/keys is severely lacking. The [documentation I can find](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation) seems to reference the 2.2 version kernel. I could not find anything newer. If you know where I can, please [let me know](#contacting-me).\n- The reference sites listed below have more comments on what each setting does.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation\n- https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-kernel-etcsysctl-conf-security-hardening/\n- https://geektnt.com/sysctl-conf-hardening.html\n- https://linoxide.com/how-tos/linux-server-protection/\n- https://github.com/klaver/sysctl/blob/master/sysctl.conf\n- https://cloudpro.zone/index.php/2018/01/30/debian-9-3-server-setup-guide-part-5/\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. The sysctl settings can be found in the [linux-kernel-sysctl-hardening.md](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/blob/master/linux-kernel-sysctl-hardening.md) file in this repo.\n\n1. Before you make a kernel sysctl change permanent, you can test it with the sysctl command:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo sysctl -w [key=value]\n    ```\n\n    Example:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo sysctl -w kernel.ctrl-alt-del=0\n    ```\n\n    **Note**: There are no spaces in `key=value`, including before and after the space.\n\n1. Once you have tested a setting, and made sure it works without breaking your server, you can make it permanent by adding the values to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. For example:\n\n    ``` bash\n    $ sudo cat /etc/sysctl.conf\n    kernel.ctrl-alt-del = 0\n    fs.file-max = 65535\n    ...\n    kernel.sysrq = 0\n    ```\n\n1. After updating the file you can reload the settings or reboot. To reload:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo sysctl -p\n    ```\n\n**Note**: If sysctl has trouble writing any settings then `sysctl -w` or `sysctl -p` will write an error to stderr. You can use this to quickly find invalid settings in  your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file:\n\n``` bash\nsudo sysctl -p >/dev/null\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Password Protect GRUB\n\n<details><summary>!! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK !!</summary>\n\n#### Why\n\nIf a bad actor has physical access to your server, they could use GRUB to gain unauthorized access to your system.\n\n#### Why Not\n\nIf you forget the password, you'll have to go through [some work](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-recovering-grub-boot-loader-password.html) to recover the password.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- auto boot the default Debian install and require a password for anything else\n\n#### Notes\n\n- This will only protect GRUB and anything behind it like your operating systems. Check your motherboard's documentation for password protecting your BIOS to prevent a bad actor from circumventing GRUB.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://selivan.github.io/2017/12/21/grub2-password-for-all-but-default-menu-entries.html\n- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords\n- https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-protect-grub-with-password-on-debian-ubuntu-and-kali-linux/\n- `man grub`\n- `man grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Create a [Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) hash of your password:\n\n    ``` bash\n    grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 -c 100000\n    ```\n\n   The below output is from using `password` as the password:\n\n    > ```\n    > Enter password:\n    > Reenter password:\n    > PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.100000.2812C233DFC899EFC3D5991D8CA74068C99D6D786A54F603E9A1EFE7BAEDDB6AA89672F92589FAF98DB9364143E7A1156C9936328971A02A483A84C3D028C4FF.C255442F9C98E1F3C500C373FE195DCF16C56EEBDC55ABDD332DD36A92865FA8FC4C90433757D743776AB186BD3AE5580F63EF445472CC1D151FA03906D08A6D\n    > ```\n\n1. Copy everything **after** `PBKDF2 hash of your password is `, **starting from and including** `grub.pbkdf2.sha512...` to the end. You'll need this in the next step.\n\n1. The `update-grub` program uses scripts to generate configuration files it will use for GRUB's settings.  Create the file `/etc/grub.d/01_password` and add the below code after replacing `[hash]` with the hash you copied from the first step. This tells `update-grub` to use this username and password for GRUB.\n\n    ``` bash\n    #!/bin/sh\n    set -e\n\n    cat << EOF\n    set superusers=\"grub\"\n    password_pbkdf2 grub [hash]\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n    For example:\n\n    > ``` bash\n    > #!/bin/sh\n    > set -e\n    > \n    > cat << EOF\n    > set superusers=\"grub\"\n    > password_pbkdf2 grub grub.pbkdf2.sha512.100000.2812C233DFC899EFC3D5991D8CA74068C99D6D786A54F603E9A1EFE7BAEDDB6AA89672F92589FAF98DB9364143E7A1156C9936328971A02A483A84C3D028C4FF.C255442F9C98E1F3C500C373FE195DCF16C56EEBDC55ABDD332DD36A92865FA8FC4C90433757D743776AB186BD3AE5580F63EF445472CC1D151FA03906D08A6D\n    > EOF\n    > ```\n\n1. Set the file's execute bit so `update-grub` includes it when it updates GRUB's configuration:\n\n   ``` bash\n   sudo chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/01_password\n   ```\n\n1. Make a backup of GRUB's configuration file `/etc/grub.d/10_linux` that we'll be modifying and unset the execute bit so `update-grub` doesn't try to run it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/grub.d/10_linux /etc/grub.d/10_linux-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo chmod a-x /etc/grub.d/10_linux.*\n    ```\n\n1. To make the default Debian install unrestricted (**without** the password) while keeping everything else restricted (**with** the password) modify `/etc/grub.d/10_linux` and add `--unrestricted` to the `CLASS` variable.\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e \"/^CLASS=/ a CLASS=\\\"\\${CLASS} --unrestricted\\\"         # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\" /etc/grub.d/10_linux\n    ```\n\n1.

PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK !!</summary>\n\n#### Why\n\nIf you have sudo [configured properly](#limit-who-can-use-sudo), then the **root** account will mostly never need to log in directly -- either at the terminal or remotely.\n\n#### Why Not\n\n**Be warned, this can cause issues with some configurations!**\n\nIf your installation uses [`sulogin`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sulogin) (like Debian) to drop to a **root** console during boot failures, then locking the **root** account will prevent `sulogin` from opening the **root** shell and you will get this error:\n\n    Cannot open access to console, the root account is locked.\n    \n    See sulogin(8) man page for more details.\n    \n    Press Enter to continue.\n\nTo work around this, you can use the `--force` option for `sulogin`. Some distributions already include this, or some other, workaround.\n\nAn alternative to locking the **root** acount is set a long/complicated **root** password and store it in a secured, non digital format. That way you have it when/if you need it.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- locked **root** account that nobody can use to log in as **root**\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Some distributions disable **root** login by default (e.g. Ubuntu) so you may not need to do this step. Check with your distribution's documentation.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806852\n- https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7115\n- https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/7ff1162e67164cb4ece19dd809c26272461aa254\n- https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11596\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/aoxd4l/new_guide_created_by_me_how_to_secure_a_linux/eg4rkfi/\n- `man systemd`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1.

PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK !!</summary>\n\n#### Why\n\numask controls the **default** permissions of files/folders when they are created. Insecure file/folder permissions give other accounts potentially unauthorized access to your data. This may include the ability to make configuration changes.\n\n- For **non-root** accounts, there is no need for other accounts to get any access to the account's files/folders **by default**.\n- For the **root** account, there is no need for the file/folder primary group or other accounts to have any access to **root**'s files/folders **by default**.\n\nWhen and if other accounts need access to a file/folder, you want to explicitly grant it using a combination of file/folder permissions and primary group.\n\n#### Why Not\n\nChanging the default umask can create unexpected problems. For example, if you set umask to `0077` for **root**, then **non-root** accounts **will not** have access to application configuration files/folders in `/etc/` which could break applications that do not run with **root** privileges.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nIn order to explain how umask works I'd have to explain how Linux file/folder permissions work. As that is a rather complicated question, I will defer you to the references below for further reading.\n\n#### Goals\n\n- set default umask for **non-root** accounts to **0027**\n- set default umask for the **root** account to **0077**\n\n#### Notes\n\n- umask is a Bash built-in which means a user can change their own umask setting.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.linuxnix.com/umask-define-linuxunix/\n- https://serverfault.com/questions/818783/which-umask-is-more-secure-in-linux-022-or-027\n- https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html\n- `man umask`\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. Make a backup of files we'll be editing:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/profile /etc/profile-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/login.defs /etc/login.defs-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    sudo cp --archive /root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Set default umask for **non-root** accounts to **0027** by adding this line to `/etc/profile` and `/etc/bash.bashrc`:\n\n    ```\n    umask 0027\n    ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    echo -e \"\\numask 0027         # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile /etc/bash.bashrc\n    ```\n\n1.

PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK !!</summary>\n\n#### Why\n\nAs you use your system, and you install and uninstall software, you'll eventually end up with orphaned, or unused software/packages/libraries. You don't need to remove them, but if you don't need them, why keep them? When security is a priority, anything not explicitly needed is a potential security threat. You want to keep your server as trimmed and lean as possible.\n\n#### Notes\n\n- Each distribution manages software/packages/libraries differently so how you find and remove orphaned packages will be different. So far I only have steps for Debian based systems.\n\n#### Debian Based Systems\n\nOn Debian based systems, you can use [deborphan](http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/deborphan/) to find orphaned packages.\n\n##### <a name=\"orphaned-software-why-not\"></a>Why Not\n\nKeep in mind, deborphan finds packages that have **no package dependencies**. That does not mean they are not used. You could very well have a package you use every day that has no dependencies that you wouldn't want to remove. And, if deborphan gets anything wrong, then removing critical packages may break your system.\n\n##### Steps\n\n1. Install deborphan.\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt install deborphan\n    ```\n\n1. Run deborphan as **root** to see a list of orphaned packages:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo deborphan\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > libxapian30\n    > libpipeline1\n    > ```\n\n1. [Assuming you want to remove all of the packages deborphan finds](#orphaned-software-why-not), you can pass it's output to `apt` to remove them:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo apt --autoremove purge $(deborphan)\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n</details><br />\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n## The Miscellaneous\n\n### The Simple way with MSMTP\n(#msmtp-alternative)\n#### Why\n\nWell I will SIMPLIFY this method, to only output email using google mail account (and others).

This will be important for system alerts/messages.\n\nYou can use any Gmail account. I recommend you create one specific for this server. That way if your server **is** compromised, the bad-actor won't have any passwords for your primary account. Granted, if you have 2FA/MFA enabled and you use an app password, there isn't much a bad-actor can do with just the app password, but why take the risk?\n\nThere are many guides on-line that cover how to configure Gmail as MTA using STARTTLS including a [previous version of this guide](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/tree/cc5edcae1cf846dd250e76b121e721d836481d2f#configure-gmail-as-mta). With STARTTLS, an initial **unencrypted** connection is made and then upgraded to an encrypted TLS or SSL connection. Instead, with the approach outlined below, an encrypted TLS connection is made from the start.\n\nAlso, as discussed in [issue #29](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/29) and [here](https://blog.dhampir.no/content/exim4-line-length-in-debian-stretch-mail-delivery-failed-returning-message-to-sender), exim4 will fail for messages with long lines.

Make a backup of `/etc/exim4/passwd.client`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/exim4/passwd.client /etc/exim4/passwd.client-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Add a line like this to `/etc/exim4/passwd.client`\n\n    ```\n    smtp.gmail.com:yourAccount@gmail.com:yourPassword\n    *.google.com:yourAccount@gmail.com:yourPassword\n    ```\n\n    **Notes**:\n    - Replace `yourAccount@gmail.com` and `yourPassword` with your details. If you have 2FA/MFA enabled on your Gmail then you'll need to create and use an app password here.\n    - Always check `host smtp.gmail.com` for the most up-to-date domains to list.\n\n1. This file has your Gmail password so we need to lock it down:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo chown root:Debian-exim /etc/exim4/passwd.client\n    sudo chmod 640 /etc/exim4/passwd.client\n    ```\n\n1. The next step is to create an TLS certificate that exim4 will use to make the encrypted connection to `smtp.gmail.com`. You can use your own certificate, like one from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or create one yourself using openssl. We will use a script that comes with exim4 that calls openssl to make our certificate:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo bash /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > [*] Creating a self signed SSL certificate for Exim!\n    >     This may be sufficient to establish encrypted connections but for\n    >     secure identification you need to buy a real certificate!\n    > \n    >     Please enter the hostname of your MTA at the Common Name (CN) prompt!\n    > \n    > Generating a RSA private key\n    > ..........................................+++++\n    > ................................................+++++\n    > writing new private key to '/etc/exim4/exim.key'\n    > -----\n    > You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated\n    > into your certificate request.\n    > What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\n    > There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\n    > For some fields there will be a default value,\n    > If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.\n    > -----\n    > Country Code (2 letters) [US]:[redacted]\n    > State or Province Name (full name) []:[redacted]\n    > Locality Name (eg, city) []:[redacted]\n    > Organization Name (eg, company; recommended) []:[redacted]\n    > Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:[redacted]\n    > Server name (eg. ssl.domain.tld; required!!!)

Instruct exim4 to use TLS and port 465, and [fix exim4's long lines issue](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/29), by creating the file `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros` and adding:\n\n    ```\n    MAIN_TLS_ENABLE = 1\n    REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS = *\n    TLS_ON_CONNECT_PORTS = 465\n    REQUIRE_PROTOCOL = smtps\n    IGNORE_SMTP_LINE_LENGTH_LIMIT = true\n    ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros\n    MAIN_TLS_ENABLE = 1\n    REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS = *\n    TLS_ON_CONNECT_PORTS = 465\n    REQUIRE_PROTOCOL = smtps\n    IGNORE_SMTP_LINE_LENGTH_LIMIT = true\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n1. Make a backup of exim4's configuration file `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template`:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo cp --archive /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template-COPY-$(date +\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    ```\n\n1. Add the below to `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template` after the `.ifdef REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS ... .endif` block:\n\n    ```\n    .ifdef REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\n      protocol = REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\n    .endif\n    ```\n\n    > ```\n    > .ifdef REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS\n    >   hosts_require_tls = REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS\n    > .endif\n    > .ifdef REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\n    >     protocol = REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\n    > .endif\n    > .ifdef REMOTE_SMTP_HEADERS_REWRITE\n    >   headers_rewrite = REMOTE_SMTP_HEADERS_REWRITE\n    > .endif\n    > ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e '/^.ifdef REMOTE_SMTP_SMARTHOST_HOSTS_REQUIRE_TLS$/I { :a; n; /^.endif$/!ba; a\\# added by '\"$(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\"'\\n.ifdef REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\\n    protocol = REQUIRE_PROTOCOL\\n.endif\\n# end add' -e '}' /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template\n    ```\n\n1.

Update exim4 configuration to use TLS and then restart the service:\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo update-exim4.conf\n    sudo service exim4 restart\n    ```\n\n1. If you're using [UFW](#ufw-uncomplicated-firewall), you'll need to allow outbound traffic on 465. To do this we'll create a custom UFW application profile and then enable it. Create the file `/etc/ufw/applications.d/smtptls`, add this, then run `ufw allow out smtptls comment 'open TLS port 465 for use with SMPT to send e-mails'`:\n\n    ```\n    [SMTPTLS]\n    title=SMTP through TLS\n    description=This opens up the TLS port 465 for use with SMPT to send e-mails.\n    ports=465/tcp\n    ```\n\n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/ufw/applications.d/smtptls\n    [SMTPTLS]\n    title=SMTP through TLS\n    description=This opens up the TLS port 465 for use with SMPT to send e-mails.\n    ports=465/tcp\n    EOF\n\n    sudo ufw allow out smtptls comment 'open TLS port 465 for use with SMPT to send e-mails'\n    ```\n\n1. Add some mail aliases so we can send e-mails to local accounts by adding lines like this to `/etc/aliases`:\n\n    ```\n    user1: user1@gmail.com\n    user2: user2@gmail.com\n    ...\n    ```\n\n    You'll need to add all the local accounts that exist on your server.\n\n1. Test your setup:\n\n    ```\n    echo \"test\" | mail -s \"Test\" email@gmail.com\n    sudo tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog\n    ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Separate iptables Log File\n\n#### Why\n\nThere will come a time when you'll need to look through your iptables logs. Having all the iptables logs go to their own file will make it a lot easier to find what you're looking for.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://blog.shadypixel.com/log-iptables-messages-to-a-separate-file-with-rsyslog/\n- https://gist.github.com/netson/c45b2dc4e835761fbccc\n- https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/actions.html\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. The first step is by telling your firewall to prefix all log entries with some unique string. If you're using iptables directly, you would do something like `--log-prefix \"[IPTABLES] \"` for all the rules. We took care of this in step [step 4 of installing psad](#psad_step4).\n\n1. After you've added a prefix to the firewall logs, we need to tell rsyslog to send those lines to its own file. Do this by creating the file `/etc/rsyslog.d/10-iptables.conf` and adding this:\n\n    ```\n    :msg, contains, \"[IPTABLES] \" /var/log/iptables.log\n    & stop\n    ```\n    \n    If you're expecting a lot if data being logged by your firewall, prefix the filename with a `-` [\"to omit syncing the file after every logging\"](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/actions.html#regular-file). For example:\n\n    ```\n    :msg, contains, \"[IPTABLES] \" -/var/log/iptables.log\n    & stop\n    ```\n\n    **Note**: Remember to change the prefix to whatever you use.\n    \n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n\n    ``` bash\n    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/rsyslog.d/10-iptables.conf\n    :msg, contains, \"[IPTABLES] \" /var/log/iptables.log\n    & stop\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n1. Since we're logging firewall messages to a different file, we need to tell psad where the new file is. Edit `/etc/psad/psad.conf` and set `IPT_SYSLOG_FILE` to the path of the log file. For example:\n\n    ```\n    IPT_SYSLOG_FILE /var/log/iptables.log;\n    ```\n    \n    **Note**: Remember to change the prefix to whatever you use.\n    \n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n    \n    ``` bash\n    sudo sed -i -r -e \"s/^(IPT_SYSLOG_FILE\\s+)([^;]+)(;)$/# \\1\\2\\3       # commented by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")\\n\\1\\/var\\/log\\/iptables.log\\3       # added by $(whoami) on $(date +\"%Y-%m-%d @ %H:%M:%S\")/\" /etc/psad/psad.conf \n    ```\n\n1. Restart psad and rsyslog to activate the changes (or reboot):\n\n    ``` bash\n    sudo psad -R\n    sudo psad --sig-update\n    sudo psad -H\n    sudo service rsyslog restart\n    ```\n\n1. The last thing we have to do is tell logrotate to rotate the new log file so it doesn't get to big and fill up our disk. Create the file `/etc/logrotate.d/iptables` and add this:\n\n    ```\n    /var/log/iptables.log\n    {\n        rotate 7\n        daily\n        missingok\n        notifempty\n        delaycompress\n        compress\n        postrotate\n            invoke-rc.d rsyslog rotate > /dev/null\n        endscript\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    [For the lazy](#editing-configuration-files---for-the-lazy):\n    \n    ``` bash\n    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/iptables\n    /var/log/iptables.log\n    {\n        rotate 7\n        daily\n        missingok\n        notifempty\n        delaycompress\n        compress\n        postrotate\n            invoke-rc.d rsyslog rotate > /dev/null\n        endscript\n    }\n    EOF\n    ```\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n## Left Over\n\n### Contacting Me\n\nFor any questions, comments, concerns, feedback, or issues, submit a [new issue](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server/issues/new).\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Helpful Links\n\n- [https://github.com/pratiktri/server_init_harden](https://github.com/pratiktri/server_init_harden) - Bash script that automates few of the tasks that you need to perform on a new Linux server to give it basic amount security.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/aopzl7/new_guide_created_by_me_how_to_secure_a_linux/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/aoxd4l/new_guide_created_by_me_how_to_secure_a_linux/\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19177435#19178618\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/arx7xo/howtosecurealinuxserver_an_evolving_howto_guide/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/arx7st/howtosecurealinuxserver_an_evolving_howto_guide/\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n\n### License and Copyright\n\n[![CC-BY-SA](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\n[How To Secure A Linux Server](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server) by [Anchal Nigam](https://github.com/imthenachoman) is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0).\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) for the full license.\n\n([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\n"

too many font sizes used. Try to use 1-2 sizes and vary other things like weight, negative space, color, casing.\n  - don't over rely on strict mathematical spacing - use optical alignment instead - make judgments based on the needs of the layout.\n  - consistent color usage. Tappable = one color. dont make titles and buttons same color. mind accessibility.\n- [Simple Layout checklist](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0gPtgNVonXPT1NsWGpKZWZKV1U/edit)\n  - [ ] Clear idea of purpose, target audience, where/how long it will be seen\n  - [ ] Information hierarchy (vary size, contrast, position)\n  - [ ] Clear visual structure - pick the most suitable way to group elements\n  - [ ] Space - leave enough whitespace. Too much > too little\n  - [ ] Alignment - use as few lines as possible\n- [Human Interface Guidelines from Apple, Microsoft, Elementary OS, IBM, etc](http://www.geofcrowl.com/blog/articles/2020/2/17/collection-higs/)\n- 50 UI tips https://fifty.user-interface.io/\n  - https://fifty.user-interface.io/50_ui_tips.pdf\n- Steve Schoger - Refactoring UI process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z9rrryIOC4\n  1.

Is it easy to see what's scrollable, swipeable, tappable, etc.? Are there areas where I know that it could be made more clear?\n    - [ ] Have I fully considered exandable/collapseable or other interactive options for some of the components?

The component has a fallback system that if for example an invalid Facebook ID is used it will try google ID and so on.\n\nYou can use this component whether you have a single source or a multiple avatar sources. In this case the fallback system will fetch the first valid avatar.\n\nMoreover, the component can shows name initials or simple value as avatar.\n\n![Angular Avatar component preview](https://cdn.rawgit.com/HaithemMosbahi/ngx-avatar/0bac9072/demo.png)\n\n\n Supported avatar sources:\n\n * Facebook\n * Google\n * Twitter\n * Instagram\n * Vkontakte (VK)\n * Skype\n * Gravatar\n * GitHub\n * Custom image\n * name initials\n * value\n\n The fallback system uses the same order as the above source list, Facebook has the highest priority, if it fails, google source will be used, and so on.\n\n If you enjoy watching videos, check out this [tutorial](https://medium.com/letsboot/lets-play-with-ngx-avatar-ec585dc39161) on medium which explains how to use ngx-avatar in your angular application.\n \n Check out this [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-avatar-demo) to play with ngx-avatar :grinning:\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall avatar component using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):\n\n```bash\n$ yarn add ngx-avatar\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n$ npm install ngx-avatar --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Import AvatarModule:\n\nOnce you have installed ngx-avatar, you can import it in your `AppModule`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import your AvatarModule\nimport { AvatarModule } from 'ngx-avatar';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    // Specify AvatarModule as an import\n    AvatarModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n```\n\nStarting from version 3.4.0:\n- `HttpClientModule` is mandatory in order to fetch the avatar from external sources (Gravatar, Google, ...).\n\n2. Start using it:\n\nOnce the AvatarModule is imported, you can start using the component in your Angular application:\n\n```html\n<ngx-avatar></ngx-avatar>\n```\n## Examples\n\n```html\n<ngx-avatar facebookId=\"1508319875\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar googleId=\"1508319875\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar twitterId=\"1508319875\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar instagramId=\"dccomics\" size=\"70\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar skypeId=\"1508319875\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar gravatarId=\"adde9b2b981a8083cf084c63ad86f753\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar gravatarId=\"user@gmail.com\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar src=\"assets/avatar.jpg\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar name=\"John Doe\"></ngx-avatar>\n<ngx-avatar value=\"75%\"></ngx-avatar>\n\n<ngx-avatar facebookId=\"userFacebookID\" skypeId=\"userSkypeID\"\n googleId=\"google\" name=\"Haithem Mosbahi\" src=\"assets/avatar.jpg\"\n value=\"28%\"  twitterId=\"twitter\"\n gravatarId=\"adde9b2b981a8083cf084c63ad86f753\" \n size=\"100\" [round]=\"true\">\n</ngx-avatar>\n\n```\nCheck out this [file](https://github.com/HaithemMosbahi/ngx-avatar/blob/master/demo/src/app/app.component.html) for more examples on how to use ngx-avatar in your application.\n\n## Demo\nCheck out this [link](https://ngx-avatar-demo.stackblitz.io/) for a live demo.\nAlso, you can play with ngx-avatar using an online editor [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-avatar-demo) on stackblitz.\n\nMoreover, the demo folder contains an application generated with angular cli that uses ngx-avatar component.\n\nTo run the demo application :\n```bash\n$ yarn install\n$ ng serve\n```\n\n\n\n## Options\n\n|   Attribute   |      Type        | Default |                                              Description                                               |\n| ------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `facebookId`  | *string \\| null* |         | Facebook ID                                                                                            |\n| `googleId`    | *string \\| null* |         |  Google ID                                                                                             |\n| `twitterId`   | *string \\| null* |         | Twitter Handle                                                                                         |\n| `instagramId`   | *string \\| null* |         | Instagram Handle                                                                                         |\n| `vkontakteId` | *string \\| null* |         | VK ID                                                                                                  |\n| `skypeId`     | *string \\| null* |         |  Skype ID                                                                                              |\n| `gravatarId`  | *string \\| null* |         | email or md5 email related to gravatar                                                                 |\n| `githubId`    | *string \\| null* |         | Github ID                                                                                              |\n| `src`         | *string \\| null* |         | Fallback image to use                                                                                  |\n| `name`        | *string \\| null* |         | Will be used to generate avatar based on the initials of the person                                    |\n| `value`       | *string \\| null* |         | Show a value as avatar                                                                                 |\n| `initialsSize`| *number*         | 0       | Restricts the size of initials - it goes along with the name property and can be used to fix the number of characters that will be displayed as initials.

The component emits the source object that has been used to fetch the avatar.|\n\n The source object has the following properties:\n * sourceType : avatar source ( Facebook, twitter, etc)\n * sourceId : identifier of the user\n * getAvatar(size) : method to fetch user avatar from the current source\n\n## Override Avatar Configuration\nThe avatar module provides the possibility of customizing the avatar component by overriding some of its options. For example, the avatar module comes with a set of default colors used to randomly fill the background color of the avatar. Thus, it's possible to change the default list of colors and to pass your own list.\n\nAll you need to do is to configure the AvatarModule by calling **forRoot** method. The forRoot method takes an AvatarConfig Object that contains the overridden options. \n\nAvatarConfig interface has two properties: \n  * **avatarColors:** allows the user to override the default avatar colors by providing a new set of colors\n  * **sourcePriorityOrder:** allows the user to change the avatar source priority order. If you want the avatar component to look for user initials first, twitter before facebook or any order you want, this is can be done using the sourcePriorityOrder property\n\nThe following code shows an example on how to import the AvatarModule with your own source priority order. \nWith the given order, the avatar component will look first for the custom avatar image and then for user initials and after that it will look the rest of sources.\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { HttpClientModule } from \"@angular/common/http\";\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { UserService } from \"./user.service\";\nimport { AvatarModule, AvatarSource } from 'ngx-avatar';\n\nconst avatarSourcesOrder = [AvatarSource.CUSTOM, AvatarSource.INITIALS];\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    // import AvatarModule in your app with your own configuration\n    AvatarModule.forRoot({\n      sourcePriorityOrder: avatarSourcesOrder\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [UserService],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n```\n\nHere's an example on how to import the AvatarModule with your own set of colors.\n\n* Starting from version 3.1, overriding the avatar configuration can be done as follows:\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { UserService } from \"./user.service\";\nimport { AvatarModule } from \"ngx-avatar\";\nimport { HttpClientModule } from \"@angular/common/http\";\n\nconst avatarColors = [\"#FFB6C1\", \"#2c3e50\", \"#95a5a6\", \"#f39c12\", \"#1abc9c\"];\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    // import AvatarModule in your app with your own configuration\n    AvatarModule.forRoot({\n      colors: avatarColors\n    })\n  ],\n  providers: [UserService],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n```\n\n* Users who use a prior version of ngx-avatar ( < 3.1 ) can override the configuration as follows:\n\n```typescript\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { UserService } from \"./user.service\";\nimport { AvatarModule,AvatarConfig } from \"ngx-avatar\";\nimport { HttpClientModule } from \"@angular/common/http\";\n\nconst avatarConfig = new AvatarConfig(['red','blue','pink']);\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    // import AvatarModule in your app with your own configuration\n    AvatarModule.forRoot(avatarConfig)\n  ],\n  providers: [UserService],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n```\n\n **Avatar Styling**\n\n In addition to the style attribute, ngx-avatar style can be customized using css classes. Thus, the generated code offers two css classes that can be overridden :\n * **avatar-container** : class that represents the avatar container - the host element. Styles in this class will be applied on the avatar whether is an image or text.\n * **avatar-content** : css class that represents the avatar element which is embedded inside the avatar-container.\n \n To overcome Angular's view encapsulation, you may need to use the /deep/ operator to target it. Here's an example that shows how to override ngx-avatar style : \n \n ```html\n   <ngx-avatar class=\"my-avatar\" value=\"HM\"> </ngx-avatar>\n ```\n Your css file might look like this \n \n ```css\n .my-avatar /deep/ .avatar-content {\n     background-color : red !important;\n }\n ```\n\n## Release Notes & History\n* 4.1.0: Angular 11 support\n* 4.0.0: Angular 9 support and minor improvements\n* 3.6.0: Angular 8 support\n* 3.5.0: export Avatar component for Angular elements and ng upgrade\n* 3.4.0: http module is removed from the library dependencies.

You may optionally configure the application to use Google Cloud Storage to handle file uploads.\n\n## A Note About Cost\nDeploying this sample will create resources that are billed to your account. It is important that you follow the instructions at the end of the tutorial to clean up all resources to prevent ongoing charges. Resources created by this tutorial include:\n\n* (2) x n1-standard-1 GCE instances + associated PD boot disks\n* (1) x n1-standard-1 GCE instances + associated PD boot disks that will run for a few minutes to do initial setup then terminate itself\n* (1) x D1 Cloud SQL instance\n* (1) x HTTP load balancer forwarding rule\n\nSee the Cost section the [solution page](http://cloud.google.com/solutions/scalable-and-resilient-apps) for more details on estimated charges.\n\nTo reduce costs, you can modify the Deployment Manager templates to provision smaller machine types, or adjust the Cloud SQL instructions to use a smaller database type.\n\n## Deployment Requirements\nBefore you deploy the sample you'll need to make sure a few things are in order:\n\n1. In the [APIs & Auth section of the Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/api) create a new project and enable the following APIs:\n\n    * Google Compute Engine\n    * Google Cloud SQL API\n    * Google Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API\n\n1. Install the Cloud SDK using [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).\n\n1. Authenticate to gcloud:\n\n        $ gcloud auth login\n\n1. Set your project:\n\n        $ gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID\n\n<a name=\"deploy\"></a>\n## Deploy the Sample\nWith `gcloud` installed and the proper APIs configured, you're ready to go.\n\n1. Clone this repository or download and unzip a [copy from Releases](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scalable-resilient-web-app/releases).\n\n1. Create a variable to hold a unique name for this deployment:\n\n        $ export DEMO_PROJECT=demo-$(date +%s)\n\n1. Create a variable to hold a unique name for your database:\n\n        $ export DB_NAME=$DEMO_PROJECT-db\n\n1. Create a Cloud SQL database:\n\n        $ gcloud sql instances create $DB_NAME \\\n          --assign-ip \\\n          --authorized-networks \"0.0.0.0/0\" \\\n          --gce-zone us-central1-f \\\n          --pricing-plan PACKAGE \\\n          --require-ssl \\\n          --replication SYNCHRONOUS \\\n          --quiet \\\n          --tier D1\n\n1. Set the root password for your database:\n\n        $ gcloud sql users create root '%' -i $DB_NAME \\\n            --password YOUR_PASSWORD\n\n1. Retrieve the Instance Name and IP address of your database: \n\n        $ gcloud sql instances describe $DB_NAME --format 'value(name)'\n        $ gcloud sql instances describe $DB_NAME --format 'value(ipAddresses[0].ipAddress)'\n\n1. Open file `dm/deployment.yaml`, replacing the `name` and `address` properties with the values retrieved in the previous step, and the `password` property with the value you set previously:\n\n        ...\n        properties:\n        database:\n            name: #Replace with your database's name\n            address: #Replace with your database's IP address\n            password: #Replace with your own strong password\n        ...\n\n1. **Optional**: If you want to use Google Cloud Storage to store files uploaded to Redmine, which is required for production environments, follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#keys) to create an access key and secret key for your application, and then paste those values into `dm/deployment.yaml`, replacing the `disabled` values:\n   \n        properties:\n            database:\n                ...\n            gcs_access_key: disabled #Replace\n            gcs_secret: disabled #Replace\n\n1. Deploy the solution:\n\n        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments \\\n            create $DEMO_PROJECT \\\n            --config dm/deployment.yaml\n\n1. Wait until the deployment status is done:\n\n        Waiting for create operation operation-1418683534250-41771e4b-ba9c-4c09-aba3-553ccb8ec5f1 to complete...done.\n        Create operation operation-1418683534250-41771e4b-ba9c-4c09-aba3-553ccb8ec5f1 completed successfully.\n\n1. In the Cloud Console open **Load balancing**, then find and click on your new load balancer:\n\n    ![](doc/view-lb.png)\n\n1. Wait until both instances are healthy.\n\n    > The process should take about 15 minutes to complete. **What's happening during that time?** Chef is downloading, compiling, and installing Ruby, along with the Redmine application and all of its Gem dependencies on each of the web server instances. In short, each instance is being fully bootstrapped. You can speed the boot time up considerably by creating a custom GCE image and pre-installing the components that take the most time. Check out the [Fast Boot with Packer](#fast) section for instructions on this approach.\n    \n    > Additionally, a special leader instance will apply the database schema, and create SSL keys for the database connection (storing them in Google Cloud Storage for the web servers to download and use for their connections).\n    \n1. All instances stream their logs to [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs). While you wait, navigate to the Logs section, choose `syslog`, click the play icon, then click Expand All to stream them to your browser:\n\n    > ![](doc/log.png)\n\n    > When the process is complete, you'll see a line indicating the startup script finished running:\n\n    > ![](doc/log-finished.png)\n\n1. When both instances are healthy, click on the IP address of your forwarding rule to view the running app:\n\n    ![](doc/health-ip.png)\n\n1. You can sign into Redmine using the application's default credentials (username=admin, password=admin, described in more detail on the official [Redmine installation page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineInstall)):\n\n    ![](doc/redmine.png)\n\n<a name=\"delete\"></a>\n## Delete the Sample\nIt is very important that you follow these instructions if you deployed a sample. If you do not delete the deployment you will continue to be charged for it.\n\nTo delete your sample deployment:\n\n1. Delete all objects in the bucket created by your sample deployment:\n\n        $ gsutil rm -r gs://$(gcloud deployment-manager resources list --deployment $DEMO_PROJECT | grep storage.v1.bucket | cut -d' ' -f1)/*\n\n1. Delete your SQL database:\n\n        $ gcloud sql instances delete $DB_NAME\n\n1. Finally, delete your deployment:\n\n        $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete $DEMO_PROJECT\n\n<a name=\"fast\"></a>\n## Fast Boot with Packer\nThe majority of the ~15 minute boot time is consumed by Chef downloading, compiling, and installing Ruby and some other dependencies. And this happens every time an instance boots. You can dramatically improve boot times by building a custom GCE image once, then deploying from that image. In this section we'll use [Packer](http://www.packer.io) to build a custom image using our existing Chef recipes, then modify the Deployment Manager templates to use that image.\n\n1. Download and install Packer from [https://packer.io/downloads.html](https://packer.io/downloads.html)\n\n1. Follow the instructions in the 'Running Without A Compute Engine Service Account' section of [https://packer.io/docs/builders/googlecompute.html](https://packer.io/docs/builders/googlecompute.html) for configuring authentication between Packer on your workstation and your GCE account.\n\n1. Open `packer.json` and replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your project ID (you can run `gcloud config list project` to find your project ID)\n\n1. Build the image:\n\n        $ packer build packer.json\n\n    This will take ~10 minutes to complete. Packer will use Chef to execute the `default`, `user`, `ruby`, and `app` recipes on a GCE instance, and then create a reusable image from that running instance. You should see output similar to:\n\n    ![](doc/packer.png)\n\n1. Use `gcloud` to retrieve the URI of the image. The regexp will filter using the image prefix Packer created the image with:\n\n        $ gcloud compute images list --regexp ^scalable-resilient-web-app-gold-[0-9]+$ --uri\n\n1. Modify the `dm/deployment.yaml` to \"fast boot\" (simply changing the `mode` attribute from 'default' to 'fast') and use the image URI you retrieved in the previous step:\n        \n        image:\n          mode: fast\n          ... \n          fast:\n            image: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/peppy-hexagon-87420/global/images/scalable-resilient-web-app-gold-1426798439 \n            chef_node_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/solutions-public-assets/scalable-resilient-web-apps/dist/node_fast.json\n            chef_cookbook_url: https://storage.googleapis.com/solutions-public-assets/scalable-resilient-web-apps/dist/chef-solo.tar.gz        \n\n1. Follow all steps from the earlier [**Deploy the Sample**](#deploy) section to create a new deployment. This includes setting environment variables and creating a Cloud SQL database.\n\n1. When you're done, follow steps in [**Delete the Sample**](#delete) to delete your deployment.\n\n1. Finally, delete the custom image you created with Packer from the Images section of the Cloud Console:\n\n    ![](doc/delete-image.png)\n\n"

The official Elasticsearch Java client can of course be used in Scala, but due to Java's syntax it is more verbose and it naturally doesn't support classes in the core Scala core library nor Scala idioms such as typeclass support.\n\nElastic4s's DSL allows you to construct your requests programatically, with syntactic and semantic errors manifested at compile time, and uses standard Scala futures to enable you to easily integrate into an asynchronous workflow. The aim of the DSL is that requests are written in a builder-like way, while staying broadly similar to the Java API or Rest API. Each request is an immutable object, so you can create requests and safely reuse them, or further copy them for derived requests. Because each request is strongly typed your IDE or editor can use the type information to show you what operations are available for any request type.\n\nElastic4s supports Scala collections so you don't have to do tedious conversions from your Scala domain classes into Java collections. It also allows you to index and read classes directly using typeclasses so you don't have to set fields or json documents manually. These typeclasses are generated using your favourite json library - modules exist for Jackson, Circe, Json4s, PlayJson and Spray Json. The client also uses standard Scala durations to avoid the use of strings or primitives for duration lengths.\n\n#### Key points\n\n* Type safe concise DSL\n* Integrates with standard Scala futures or other effects libraries\n* Uses Scala collections library over Java collections\n* Returns `Option` where the java methods would return null\n* Uses Scala `Duration`s instead of strings/longs for time values\n* Supports typeclasses for indexing, updating, and search backed by Jackson, Circe, Json4s, PlayJson and Spray Json implementations\n* Supports Java and Scala HTTP clients such as Akka-Http\n* Provides [reactive-streams](#elastic-reactive-streams) implementation\n* Provides a testkit subproject ideal for your tests\n\n### Release\n\nCurrent Elastic4s versions support Scala 2.12 and 2.13. Scala 2.10 support has been dropped starting with 5.0.x and Scala 2.11 has been dropped starting with 7.2.0.

  ||\n\nFor release prior to 6.0 search maven central directly.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWe have created sample projects in both sbt, maven and gradle. Check them out here:\nhttps://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/tree/master/samples\n\nTo get started you will need to add a dependency:\n\n* [elastic4s-client-esjava](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sksamuel.elastic4s/a:elastic4s-client-esjava)\n\n```scala\n// major.minor are in sync with the elasticsearch releases\nval elastic4sVersion = \"x.x.x\"\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\n  // recommended client for beginners\n  \"com.sksamuel.elastic4s\" %% \"elastic4s-client-esjava\" % elastic4sVersion,\n  // test kit\n  \"com.sksamuel.elastic4s\" %% \"elastic4s-testkit\" % elastic4sVersion % \"test\"\n)\n```\n\nThe basic usage is that you create an instance of a client and then invoke the `execute` method with the requests you\nwant to perform. The execute method is asynchronous and will return a standard Scala `Future[T]`\n(or use one of the [Alternative executors](#alternative-executors)) where T is the response\ntype appropriate for your request type. For example a _search_ request will return a response of type `SearchResponse`\nwhich contains the results of the search.\n\nTo create an instance of the HTTP client, use the `ElasticClient` companion object methods.\nRequests are created using the elastic4s DSL. For example to create a search request, you would do:\n\n```scala\nsearch(\"index\").query(\"findthistext\")\n```\n\nThe DSL methods are located in the `ElasticDsl` trait which needs to be imported or extended.\n\n```scala\nimport com.sksamuel.elastic4s.ElasticDsl._\n```\n\n\n## Creating a Client\n\nThe entry point in elastic4s is an instance of `ElasticClient`.\nThis class is used to execute requests, such as `SearchRequest`, against an Elasticsearch cluster and returns a response type such as `SearchResponse`.\n\n`ElasticClient` takes care of transforming the requests and responses, and handling success and failure, but the actual HTTP functions are delegated to a HTTP library.\nOne such library is `JavaClient` which uses the http client provided by the offical Java elasticsearch library.\n\nSo, to connect to an ElasticSearch cluster, pass an instance of `JavaClient` to an `ElasticClient`.\n`JavaClient` is configured using `ElasticProperties` in which you can specify protocol, host, and port in a single string.\n\n```scala\nval props = ElasticProperties(\"http://host1:9200\")\nval client = ElasticClient(JavaClient(props))\n```\n\nFor multiple nodes you can pass a comma-separated list of endpoints in a single string:\n\n```scala\nval nodes = ElasticProperties(\"http://host1:9200,host2:9200,host3:9200\")\nval client = ElasticClient(JavaClient(nodes))\n```\n\nThere are several http libraries to choose from, or you can wrap any HTTP library you wish. For further details, and information\non how to specify credentials and other options, see [the full client documentation](docs/clients.md)\n\n\n## Example Application\n\nAn example is worth 1000 characters so here is a quick example of how to connect to a node with a client, create an\nindex and index a one field document. Then we will search for that document using a simple text query.\n\n**Note:** As of version `0.7.x` the `LocalNode` functionality has been removed. It is recommended that you stand up\na local ElasticSearch Docker container for development. This is the same strategy used in the [tests](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/blob/master/elastic4s-testkit/src/main/scala/com/sksamuel/elastic4s/testkit/DockerTests.scala).\n\n```scala\nimport com.sksamuel.elastic4s.fields.TextField\nimport com.sksamuel.elastic4s.http.JavaClient\nimport com.sksamuel.elastic4s.requests.common.RefreshPolicy\nimport com.sksamuel.elastic4s.requests.searches.SearchResponse\n\nobject ArtistIndex extends App {\n\n  // in this example we create a client to a local Docker container at localhost:9200\n  val client = ElasticClient(JavaClient(ElasticProperties(s\"http://${sys.env.getOrElse(\"ES_HOST\", \"127.0.0.1\")}:${sys.env.getOrElse(\"ES_PORT\", \"9200\")}\")))\n\n  // we must import the dsl\n  import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.ElasticDsl._\n\n  // Next we create an index in advance ready to receive documents.\n  // await is a helper method to make this operation synchronous instead of async\n  // You would normally avoid doing this in a real program as it will block\n  // the calling thread but is useful when testing\n  client.execute {\n    createIndex(\"artists\").mapping(\n      properties(\n        TextField(\"name\")\n      )\n    )\n  }.await\n\n  // Next we index a single document which is just the name of an Artist.\n  // The RefreshPolicy.Immediate means that we want this document to flush to the disk immediately.\n  // see the section on Eventual Consistency.\n  client.execute {\n    indexInto(\"artists\").fields(\"name\" -> \"L.S. Lowry\").refresh(RefreshPolicy.Immediate)\n  }.await\n\n  // now we can search for the document we just indexed\n  val resp = client.execute {\n    search(\"artists\").query(\"lowry\")\n  }.await\n\n  // resp is a Response[+U] ADT consisting of either a RequestFailure containing the\n  // Elasticsearch error details, or a RequestSuccess[U] that depends on the type of request.\n  // In this case it is a RequestSuccess[SearchResponse]\n\n  println(\"---- Search Results ----\")\n  resp match {\n    case failure: RequestFailure => println(\"We failed \" + failure.error)\n    case results: RequestSuccess[SearchResponse] => println(results.result.hits.hits.toList)\n    case results: RequestSuccess[_] => println(results.result)\n  }\n\n  // Response also supports familiar combinators like map / flatMap / foreach:\n  resp foreach (search => println(s\"There were ${search.totalHits} total hits\"))\n\n  client.close()\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Alternative Executors\n\nBy default, elastic4s uses scala `Future`s when returning responses, but any effect type can be supported.\n\nIf you wish to use ZIO, Cats-Effect, Monix or Scalaz, then read this page on [alternative effects](docs/effects.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Index Refreshing\n\nWhen you index a document in Elasticsearch, usually it is not immediately available to be searched, as a _refresh_ has to happen to make it visible to the search API.\n\nBy default a refresh occurs every second but this can be changed if needed.\nNote that this only impacts the visibility of newly indexed documents and has nothing\nto do with data consistency and durability.\n\nThis setting can be [controlled](docs/refresh.md) when creating an index or when indexed documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Create Index\n\nAll documents in Elasticsearch are stored in an index. We do not need to tell Elasticsearch in advance what an index\nwill look like (eg what fields it will contain) as Elasticsearch will adapt the index dynamically as more documents are added, but we must at least create the index first.\n\nTo create an index called \"places\" that is fully dynamic we can simply use:\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  createIndex(\"places\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can optionally set the number of shards and/or replicas\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  createIndex(\"places\").shards(3).replicas(2)\n}\n```\n\nSometimes we want to specify the properties of the fields in the index in advance.\nThis allows us to manually set the type of the field (where Elasticsearch might infer something else) or set the analyzer used,\nor multiple other options\n\nTo do this we add mappings:\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n    createIndex(\"cities\").mapping(\n        properties(\n            keywordField(\"id\"),\n            textField(\"name\").boost(4),\n            textField(\"content\"),\n            keywordField(\"country\"),\n            keywordField(\"continent\")\n        )\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThen Elasticsearch is preconfigured with those mappings for those fields.\nIt is still fully dynamic and other fields will be created as needed with default options. Only the fields specified will have their type preset.\n\nMore examples on the create index syntax can be [found here](https://sksamuel.github.io/elastic4s/docs/indices/createindex.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Analyzers\n\nAnalyzers control how Elasticsearch parses the fields for indexing. For example, you might decide that you want\nwhitespace to be important, so that \"band of brothers\" is indexed as a single \"word\" rather than the default which is\nto split on whitespace. There are many advanced options available in analayzers. Elasticsearch also allows us to create\ncustom analyzers. For more details [see the documentation on analyzers](docs/analysis.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Indexing\n\nTo index a document we need to specify the index and type and optionally we can set an id.\nIf we don't include an id then elasticsearch will generate one for us.\nWe must also include at least one field. Fields are specified as standard tuples.\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  indexInto(\"cities\").id(\"123\").fields(\n    \"name\" -> \"London\",\n    \"country\" -> \"United Kingdom\",\n    \"continent\" -> \"Europe\",\n    \"status\" -> \"Awesome\"\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThere are many additional options we can set such as routing, version, parent, timestamp and op type.\nSee [official documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/index_/) for additional options, all of\nwhich exist in the DSL as keywords that reflect their name in the official API.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Indexable Typeclass\n\nSometimes it is useful to create documents directly from your domain model instead of manually creating maps of fields.\nTo achieve this, elastic4s provides the `Indexable` typeclass.\n\nIf you provide an implicit instance of `Indexable[T]` in scope for any\nclass T that you wish to index, and then you can invoke `doc(t)` on the `IndexRequest`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```scala\n// a simple example of a domain model\ncase class Character(name: String, location: String)\n\n// turn instances of characters into json\nimplicit object CharacterIndexable extends Indexable[Character] {\n  override def json(t: Character): String = s\"\"\" { \"name\" : \"${t.name}\", \"location\" : \"${t.location}\" } \"\"\"\n}\n\n// now index requests can directly use characters as docs\nval jonsnow = Character(\"jon snow\", \"the wall\")\nclient.execute {\n  indexInto(\"gameofthrones\").doc(jonsnow)\n}\n```\n\nSome people prefer to write typeclasses manually for the types they need to support. Other people like to just have\nit done automagically. For the latter, elastic4s provides extensions for the well known Scala Json libraries that\ncan be used to generate Json generically.\n\nTo use this, add the import for your chosen library below and bring the implicits into scope. Then you can pass any case class\ninstance to `doc` and an `Indexable` will be derived automatically.\n\n| Library | Elastic4s Module | Import |\n|---------|------------------|--------|\n|[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala)|[elastic4s-json-jackson](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-jackson)|import ElasticJackson.Implicits._|\n|[Json4s](http://json4s.org/)|[elastic4s-json-json4s](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-json4s)|import ElasticJson4s.Implicits._|\n|[Circe](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe)|[elastic4s-json-circe](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-circe)|import io.circe.generic.auto._ <br/>import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.circe._|\n|[PlayJson](https://github.com/playframework/play-json)|[elastic4s-json-play](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-play)|import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.playjson._|\n|[Spray Json](https://github.com/spray/spray-json)|[elastic4s-json-spray](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-spray)|import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.sprayjson._|\n|[ZIO Json](https://github.com/zio/zio-json)|[elastic4s-json-zio](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Celastic4s-json-spray)|import com.sksamuel.elastic4s.ziojson._|\n\n\n\n\n\n## Searching\n\nTo execute a [search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/) in elastic4s, we need to pass an instance of `SearchRequest` to our client.\n\nOne way to do this is to invoke `search` and pass in the index name. From there, you can call\n`query` and pass in the type of query you want to perform.\n\nFor example, to perform a simple text search, where the query is parsed from a single string we can do:\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  search(\"cities\").query(\"London\")\n}\n```\n\nFor full details on creating queries and other search capabilities such source filtering and aggregations, please read [this](docs/search.md).\n\n\n\n## Multisearch\n\nMultiple search requests can be executed in a single call using the [multisearch](docs/multisearch.md) request type. This is the search equivilent of the bulk request.\n\n\n\n## HitReader Typeclass\n\nBy default Elasticsearch search responses contain an array of `SearchHit` instances which contain things like the id,\nindex, type, version, etc as well as the document source as a string or map. Elastic4s provides a means to convert these\nback to meaningful domain types quite easily using the `HitReader[T]` typeclass.\n\nProvide an implementation of this typeclass, as an in scope implicit, for whatever type you wish to marshall search responses into, and then you can call `to[T]` or `safeTo[T]` on the response.\nThe difference between `to` and `safeTo` is that `to` will drop any errors and just return successful conversions, whereas safeTo returns\na sequence of `Either[Throwable, T]`.\n\nA full example:\n\n```scala\ncase class Character(name: String, location: String)\n\nimplicit object CharacterHitReader extends HitReader[Character] {\n  override def read(hit: Hit): Either[Throwable, Character] = {\n    val source = hit.sourceAsMap\n    Right(Character(source(\"name\").toString, source(\"location\").toString))\n  }\n}\n\nval resp = client.execute {\n  search(\"gameofthrones\").query(\"kings landing\")\n}.await // don't block in real code\n\n// .to[Character] will look for an implicit HitReader[Character] in scope\n// and then convert all the hits into Characters for us.\nval characters: Seq[Character] = resp.result.to[Character]\n```\n\nThis is basically the inverse of the `Indexable` typeclass. And just like Indexable, the json modules provide implementations\nout of the box for any types. The imports are the same as for the Indexable typeclasses.\n\nAs a bonus feature of the Jackson implementation, if your domain object has fields called `_timestamp`, `_id`, `_type`, `_index`, or\n`_version` then those special fields will be automatically populated as well.\n\n\n\n\n## Highlighting\n\nElasticsearch can annotate results to show which part of the results matched the queries by using highlighting.\nJust think when you're in google and you see the snippets underneath your results - that's what highlighting does.\n\nWe can use this very easily, just add a highlighting definition to your search request, where you set the field or fields to be highlighted. Viz:\n\n```scala\nsearch(\"music\").query(\"kate bush\").highlighting (\n  highlight(\"body\").fragmentSize(20)\n)\n```\n\nAll very straightforward. There are many options you can use to tweak the results. In the example above I have\nsimply set the snippets to be taken from the field called \"body\" and to have max length 20. You can set the number of fragments to return, seperate queries to generate them and other things. See the elasticsearch page on [highlighting](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html) for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Get / Multiget\n\nA [get](docs/get.md) request allows us to retrieve a document directly by id.\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  get(\"bands\", \"coldplay\")\n}\n```\n\nWe can fetch multiple documents at once using the [multiget](docs/multiget.md) request.\n\n\n\n\n## Deleting\n\nIn elasticsearch we can delete based on an id, or based on a query (which can match multiple documents).\n\nSee more about [delete](docs/delete.md).\n\n\n\n## Updates\n\nWe can update existing documents without having to do a full index, by updating a partial set of fields.\nWe can _update-by-id_ or _update-by-query_.\n\nFor more details see the [update](docs/update.md) page.\n\n## More like this\n\nIf you want to return documents that are \"similar\" to  a current document we can do that very easily with the more like this query.\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  search(\"drinks\").query {\n    moreLikeThisQuery(\"name\").likeTexts(\"coors\", \"beer\", \"molson\").minTermFreq(1).minDocFreq(1)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor all the options see [here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/mlt-query/).\n\n\n\n## Count\n\nA [count request](docs/count.md) executes a query and returns a count of the number of matching documents for that query.\n\n\n\n\n## Bulk Operations\n\nElasticsearch is fast. Roundtrips are not. Sometimes we want to wrestle every last inch of performance and a useful way\nto do this is to batch up requests. We can do this in elasticsearch via the bulk API. A bulk request wraps index,\ndelete and update requests in a single request.\n\n```scala\nclient.execute {\n  bulk(\n    indexInto(\"bands\").fields(\"name\" -> \"coldplay\"), // one index request\n    deleteById(\"bands\", \"123\"), // a delete by id request\n    indexInto(\"bands\").fields( // second index request\n      \"name\" -> \"elton john\",\n      \"best_album\" -> \"tumbleweed connection\"\n    )\n  )\n}\n```\nA single HTTP request is now needed for 3 operations. In addition Elasticsearch can now optimize the requests,\nby combining inserts or using aggressive caching.\n\nFor full details see the [docs on bulk operations](docs/bulk.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Show Query JSON\n\nIt can be useful to see the json output of requests in case you wish to tinker with the request in a REST client or your browser. It can be much easier to tweak a complicated query when you have the instant feedback of the HTTP interface.\n\nElastic4s makes it easy to get this json where possible. Simply invoke the `show` method on the client with a request to get back a json string. Eg:\n\n```scala\nval json = client.show {\n  search(\"music\").query(\"coldplay\")\n}\nprintln(json)\n```\n\nNot all requests have a json body. For example _get-by-id_ is modelled purely by http query parameters, there is no json body to output. And some requests aren't supported by the show method - you will get an implicit not found error during compliation if that is the case\n\n\n\n\n## Aliases\n\nAn [index alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html) is a logical name used to reference one or more indices. Most Elasticsearch APIs accept an index alias in place of an index name.\n\nFor elastic4s syntax for aliases [click here](docs/alias.md).\n\n\n\n\n## Explain\n\nAn [explain request](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-explain.html) computes a score explanation for a query and a specific document. This can give useful feedback whether a document matches or didn’t match a specific query.\n\nFor elastic4s syntax for explain [click here](docs/explain.md).\n\n\n\n\n## Validate Query\n\nThe validate query request type allows you to check a query is valid before executing it.\n\nSee the syntax [here](docs/validate.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Force Merge\n\nMerging reduces the number of segments in each shard by merging some of them together, and also frees up the space used by deleted documents. Merging normally happens automatically, but sometimes it is useful to trigger a merge manually.\n\nSee the syntax [here](docs/force_merge.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Cluster APIs\n\nElasticsearch supports querying the state of the cluster itself, to find out information on nodes, shards, indices, tasks and so on. See the range of cluster APIs [here](docs/cluster.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Search Iterator\n\nSometimes you may wish to iterate over all the results in a search, without worrying too much about handling futures, and re-requesting\nvia a scroll. The `SearchIterator` will do this for you, although it will block between requests. A search iterator is just an implementation\nof `scala.collection.Iterator` backed by elasticsearch queries.\n\nTo create one, use the iterate method on the companion object, passing in the http client, and a search request to execute. The\nsearch request must specify a keep alive value (which is used by elasticsearch for scrolling).\n\n```scala\nimplicit val reader : HitReader[MyType] =  ...\nval iterator = SearchIterator.iterate[MyType](client, search(index).matchAllQuery.keepAlive(\"1m\").size(50))\niterator.foreach(println)\n```\n\nFor instance, in the above we are bringing back all documents in the index, 50 results at a time, marshalled into\ninstances of `MyType` using the implicit `HitReader` (see the section on HitReaders). If you want just the raw\nelasticsearch `Hit` object, then use `SearchIterator.hits`\n\nNote: Whenever the results in a particular\nbatch have been iterated on, the `SearchIterator` will then execute another query for the next batch and block waiting on that query.\nSo if you are looking for a pure non blocking solution, consider the reactive streams implementation. However, if you just want a\nquick and simple way to iterate over some data without bringing back all the results at once `SearchIterator` is perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Elastic Reactive Streams\n\nElastic4s has an implementation of the [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) api for both publishing and subscribing that is built\nusing Akka. To use this, you need to add a dependency on the elastic4s-streams module.\n\nThere are two things you can do with the reactive streams implementation. You can create an elastic subscriber, and have that\nstream data from some publisher into elasticsearch. Or you can create an elastic publisher and have documents streamed out to subscribers.\n\nFor full details read the [streams documentation](docs/streams.md)\n\n## Using Elastic4s in your project\n\nFor gradle users, add (replace 2.12 with 2.13 for Scala 2.13):\n\n```groovy\ncompile 'com.sksamuel.elastic4s:elastic4s-core_2.12:x.x.x'\n```\n\nFor SBT users simply add:\n\n```scala\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.sksamuel.elastic4s\" %% \"elastic4s-core\" % \"x.x.x\"\n```\n\nFor Maven users simply add (replace 2.12 with 2.13 for Scala 2.13):\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.sksamuel.elastic4s</groupId>\n    <artifactId>elastic4s-core_2.12</artifactId>\n    <version>x.x.x</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nCheck for the latest released versions on [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.sksamuel.elastic4s%22)\n\n## Building and Testing\n\nThis project is built with SBT. So to build with:\n\n```scala\nsbt compile\n```\n\nAnd to test:\n\n```scala\nsbt test\n```\nThe project is currently [cross-built](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Cross-Build.html) against Scala 2.12 and\n2.13, when preparing a pull request the above commands should be run with the `sbt` `+` modifier to compile and test\nagainst both versions. For example: `sbt +compile`.\n\nFor the tests to work you will need to run a local elastic instance on port 39227, _with security enabled_. One easy way of doing this is to use docker (via docker-compose):\n`docker-compose up`\n\n## Used By\n* Barclays Bank\n* HSBC\n* Shazaam\n* Lenses\n* Iterable\n* Graphflow\n* Hotel Urbano\n* Immobilien Scout\n* Deutsche Bank\n* Goldman Sachs\n* HMRC\n* Canal+\n* AOE\n* Starmind\n* ShopRunner\n* Soundcloud\n* Rostelecom-Solar\n* Shoprunner\n* Twitter\n* bluerootlabs.io\n* mapp.com\n\n_Raise a PR to add your company here_\n\n![youkit logo](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png) YourKit supports open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler.\nYourKit, LLC is the creator of <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp\">YourKit Java Profiler</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/index.jsp\">YourKit .NET Profiler</a>,\ninnovative and intelligent tools for profiling Java and .NET applications.\n\n## Contributions\nContributions to elastic4s are always welcome.

Works with ruby + rspec.\n\nPuffing Billy is like [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) or\n[VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr), but for your browser.\n\n![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Puffing_Billy_1862.jpg)\n\n## Overview\n\nBilly spawns an EventMachine-based proxy server, which it uses to intercept\nrequests sent by your browser. It has a simple API for configuring which\nrequests need stubbing and what they should return.\n\nBilly lets you test against known, repeatable data. It also allows you to\ntest for failure cases.  Does your twitter (or facebook/google/etc)\nintegration degrade gracefully when the API starts returning 500s? Well now\nyou can test it!\n\n```ruby\nit 'should stub google' do\n  proxy.stub('http://www.google.com/').and_return(text: \"I'm not Google!\")\n  visit 'http://www.google.com/'\n  expect(page).to have_content(\"I'm not Google!\")\nend\n```\n\nYou can also record HTTP interactions and replay them later. See\n[caching](#caching) below.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your application's `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'puffing-billy', group: :test\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n```sh\n$ bundle\n```\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n```sh\n$ gem install puffing-billy\n```\n\n## Setup for Capybara\n\nIn your `rails_helper.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'billy/capybara/rspec'\n\n# select a driver for your chosen browser environment\nCapybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_billy # Uses Firefox\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_headless_billy # Uses Firefox in headless mode\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_chrome_billy\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_chrome_headless_billy\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :apparition_billy\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit_billy\n# Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist_billy\n```\n\n> __Note__: `:poltergeist_billy` doesn't support proxying any localhosts, so you must use\n`:webkit_billy`, `:apparition_billy`, or a custom headless selenium registration for\nheadless specs when using puffing-billy for other local rack apps.\nSee [this phantomjs issue](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11342) for any updates.\n\n## Setup for Watir\n\nIn your `rails_helper.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'billy/watir/rspec'\n\n# select a driver for your chosen browser environment\n@browser = Billy::Browsers::Watir.new :firefox\n# @browser = Billy::Browsers::Watir.new = :chrome\n# @browser = Billy::Browsers::Watir.new = :phantomjs\n```\n\n## Setup for Cucumber\n\nAn example feature:\n\n```\nFeature: Stubbing via billy\n\n  @javascript @billy\n  Scenario: Test billy\n    And a stub for google\n```\n\n### Setup for Cucumber + Capybara\n\nIn your `features/support/env.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'billy/capybara/cucumber'\n\nAfter do\n  Capybara.use_default_driver\nend\n```\n\nAnd in steps:\n\n```ruby\nBefore('@billy') do\n  Capybara.current_driver = :poltergeist_billy\nend\n\nAnd /^a stub for google$/ do\n  proxy.stub('http://www.google.com/').and_return(text: \"I'm not Google!\")\n  visit 'http://www.google.com/'\n  expect(page).to have_content(\"I'm not Google!\")\nend\n```\n\nIt's good practice to reset the driver after each scenario, so having an\n`@billy` tag switches the drivers on for a given scenario. Also note that\nstubs are reset after each step, so any usage of a stub should be in the\nsame step that it was created in.\n\n### Setup for Cucumber + Watir\n\nIn your `features/support/env.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'billy/watir/cucumber'\n\nAfter do\n  @browser.close\nend\n```\n\nAnd in steps:\n\n```ruby\nBefore('@billy') do\n  @browser = Billy::Browsers::Watir.new :firefox\nend\n\nAnd /^a stub for google$/ do\n  proxy.stub('http://www.google.com/').and_return(text: \"I'm not Google!\")\n  @browser.goto 'http://www.google.com/'\n  expect(@browser.text).to eq(\"I'm not Google!\")\nend\n```\n\n## Minitest Usage\n\nPlease see [this link](https://gist.github.com/sauy7/1b081266dd453a1b737b) for\ndetails and report back to [Issue #49](https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy/issues/49)\nif you get it fully working.\n\n## Examples\n\n```ruby\n# Stub and return text, json, jsonp (or anything else)\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/text/').and_return(text: 'Foobar')\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/json/').and_return(json: { foo: 'bar' })\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/jsonp/').and_return(jsonp: { foo: 'bar' })\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/headers/').and_return(\n  headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' => '*' },\n  json: { foo: 'bar' }\n)\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/wtf/').and_return(body: 'WTF!?', content_type: 'text/wtf')\n\n# Stub redirections and other return codes\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/redirect/').and_return(redirect_to: 'http://example.com/other')\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/missing/').and_return(code: 404, body: 'Not found')\n\n# Even stub HTTPS!\nproxy.stub('https://example.com:443/secure/').and_return(text: 'secrets!!1!')\n\n# Pass a Proc (or Proc-style object) to create dynamic responses.\n#\n# The proc will be called with the following arguments:\n#   params:  Query string parameters hash, CGI::escape-style\n#   headers: Headers hash\n#   body:    Request body string\n#   url:     The actual URL which was requested\n#   method:  The HTTP verb which was requested\nproxy.stub('https://example.com/proc/').and_return(Proc.new { |params, headers, body, url, method|\n  {\n    code: 200,\n    text: \"Hello, #{params['name'][0]}\"\n  }\n})\n\n# You can also use Puffing Billy to intercept requests and responses. Just pass\n# a Proc and use the pass_request method. You can manipulate the request\n# (headers, URL, HTTP method, etc) and also the response from the upstream\n# server. The scope of the delivered callable is the user scope where\n# it was defined. Setting method to 'all' will intercept requests regardless of\n# the method.\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/', method: 'all').and_return(Proc.new { |*args|\n  response = Billy.pass_request(*args)\n  response[:headers]['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'\n  response[:body] = 'Hello World!'\n  response[:code] = 200\n  response\n})\n\n# Stub out a POST. Don't forget to allow a CORS request and set the method to 'post'\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/api', method: 'post').and_return(\n  headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' => '*' },\n  code: 201\n)\n\n# Stub out an OPTIONS request. Set the headers to the values you require.\nproxy.stub('http://example.com/api', method: 'options').and_return(\n  headers: {\n    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' => 'GET, PATCH, POST, PUT, OPTIONS',\n    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' => 'X-Requested-With, X-Prototype-Version, Content-Type',\n    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'  => '*'\n  },\n  code: 200\n)\n```\n\nStubs are reset between tests.  Any requests that are not stubbed will be\nproxied to the remote server.\n\nIf for any reason you'd need to reset stubs manually you can do it in two ways:\n\n```ruby\n# reset a single stub\nexample_stub = proxy.stub('http://example.com/text/').and_return(text: 'Foobar')\nproxy.unstub example_stub\n\n# reset all stubs\nproxy.reset\n```\n\n## Caching\n\nRequests routed through the external proxy are cached.\n\nBy default, all requests to localhost or 127.0.0.1 will not be cached. If\nyou're running your test server with a different hostname, you'll need to\nadd that host to puffing-billy's whitelist.\n\nIn your `rails_helper.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.whitelist = ['test.host', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1'] # To replace the default whitelist, OR\n  c.whitelist << 'mynewhost.local' # to append a host without overriding the defaults.\nend\n```\n\nIf you would like to cache other local rack apps, you must whitelist only the\nspecific port for the application that is executing tests.  If you are using\n[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), this can be accomplished by\nadding this in your `rails_helper.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nserver = Capybara.current_session.server\nBilly.config.whitelist = [\"#{server.host}:#{server.port}\"]\n```\n\nIf you would like to cache whitelisted URLs, you can define them in `c.cache_whitelist`. This is useful for scenarios where you may want to set `c.non_whitelisted_requests_disabled` to `true` to only allow whitelisted URLs to be accessed, but still allow specific URLs to be treated as if they were non-whitelisted.\n\nIf you want to use puffing-billy like you would [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)\nyou can turn on cache persistence. This way you don't have to manually mock out\neverything as requests are automatically recorded and played back. With cache\npersistence you can take tests completely offline.\n\n```ruby\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.cache = true\n  c.cache_request_headers = false\n  c.ignore_params = [\"http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif\",\n                     \"https://r.twimg.com/jot\",\n                     \"http://p.twitter.com/t.gif\",\n                     \"http://p.twitter.com/f.gif\",\n                     \"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php\",\n                     \"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth\",\n                     \"http://cdn.api.twitter.com/1/urls/count.json\"]\n  c.path_blacklist = []\n  c.merge_cached_responses_whitelist = []\n  c.persist_cache = true\n  c.ignore_cache_port = true # defaults to true\n  c.non_successful_cache_disabled = false\n  c.non_successful_error_level = :warn\n  c.non_whitelisted_requests_disabled = false\n  c.cache_path = 'spec/req_cache/'\n  c.certs_path = 'spec/req_certs/'\n  c.proxy_host = 'example.com' # defaults to localhost\n  c.proxy_port = 12345 # defaults to random\n  c.proxied_request_host = nil\n  c.proxied_request_port = 80\n  c.cache_whitelist = []\n  c.record_requests = true # defaults to false\n  c.cache_request_body_methods = ['post', 'patch', 'put'] # defaults to ['post']\nend\n```\n\nThe cache works with all types of requests and will distinguish between\ndifferent POST requests to the same URL.\n\n`c.cache_request_headers` is used to store the outgoing request headers in the cache.\nIt is also saved to yml if `persist_cache` is enabled.  This additional information\nis useful for debugging (for example: viewing the referer of the request).\n\n`c.ignore_params` is used to ignore parameters of certain requests when\ncaching. You should mostly use this for analytics and various social buttons as\nthey use cache avoidance techniques, but return practically the same response\nthat most often does not affect your test results.\n\n`c.allow_params` is used to allow parameters of certain requests when caching. This is best used when a site\nhas a large number of analytics and social buttons. `c.allow_params` is the opposite of `c.ignore_params`,\na whitelist to a blacklist. In order to toggle between using one or the other, use `c.use_ignore_params`.\n\n`c.strip_query_params` is used to strip query parameters when you stub some requests\nwith query parameters. Default value is true. For example, `proxy.stub('http://myapi.com/user/?country=FOO')`\nis considered the same as: `proxy.stub('http://myapi.com/user/?anything=FOO')` and\ngenerally the same as: `proxy.stub('http://myapi.com/user/')`. When you need to distinguish between all these requests,\nyou may set this config value to false.\n\n`c.dynamic_jsonp` is used to rewrite the body of JSONP responses based on the\ncallback parameter. For example, if a request to `http://example.com/foo?callback=bar`\nreturns `bar({\"some\": \"json\"});` and is recorded, then a later request to\n`http://example.com/foo?callback=baz` will be a cache hit and respond with\n`baz({\"some\": \"json\"});` This is useful because most JSONP implementations\nbase the callback name off of a timestamp or something else dynamic.\n\n`c.dynamic_jsonp_keys` is used to configure which parameters to ignore when\nusing `c.dynamic_jsonp`. This is helpful when JSONP APIs use cache-busting\nparameters. For example, if you want `http://example.com/foo?callback=bar&id=1&cache_bust=12345` and `http://example.com/foo?callback=baz&id=1&cache_bust=98765` to be cache hits for each other, you would set `c.dynamic_jsonp_keys = ['callback', 'cache_bust']` to ignore both params. Note\nthat in this example the `id` param would still be considered important.\n\n`c.dynamic_jsonp_callback_name` is used to configure the name of the JSONP callback\nparameter. The default is `callback`.\n\n`c.path_blacklist = []` is used to always cache specific paths on any hostnames,\nincluding whitelisted ones.  This is useful if your AUT has routes that get data\nfrom external services, such as `/api` where the ajax request is a local URL but\nthe actual data is coming from a different application that you want to cache.\n\n`c.merge_cached_responses_whitelist = []` is used to group together the cached\nresponses for specific uri regexes that match any part of the url. This is useful\nfor ensuring that any kind of analytics and various social buttons that have\nslightly different urls each time can be recorded once and reused nicely. Note\nthat the request body is ignored for requests that contain a body.\n\n`c.ignore_cache_port` is used to strip the port from the URL if it exists.  This\nis useful when caching local paths (via `path_blacklist`) or other local rack apps\nthat are running on random ports.\n\n`c.non_successful_cache_disabled` is used to not cache responses without 200-series\nor 304 status codes.  This prevents unauthorized or internal server errors from\nbeing cached and used for future test runs.\n\n`c.non_successful_error_level` is used to log when non-successful responses are\nreceived.  By default, it just writes to the log file, but when set to `:error`\nit throws an error with the URL and status code received for easier debugging.\n\n`c.non_whitelisted_requests_disabled` is used to disable hitting new URLs when\nno cache file exists.  Only whitelisted URLs (on non-blacklisted paths) are\nallowed, all others will throw an error with the URL attempted to be accessed.\nThis is useful for debugging issues in isolated environments (ie.\ncontinuous integration).\n\n`c.cache_path` can be used to locate the cache directory to a different place\nother than `system temp directory/puffing-billy`.\n\n`c.certs_path` can be used to locate the directory for dynamically generated\nSSL certificates to a different place other than `system temp\ndirectory/puffing-billy/certs`.\n\n`c.proxy_host` and `c.proxy_port` are used for the Billy proxy itself which runs locally.\n\n`c.proxied_request_host` and `c.proxied_request_port` are used if an internal proxy\nserver is required to access the internet.  Most common in larger companies.\n\n`c.record_requests` can be used to record all requests that puffing billy proxied.\nThis can be useful for debugging purposes, for instance if you are unsure why\nyour stubbed requests are not being successfully proxied.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'table_print' # Add this dependency to your gemfile\n\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.record_requests = true\nend\n\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.prepend_after(:example, type: :feature) do\n    puts \"Requests received via Puffing Billy Proxy:\"\n\n    puts TablePrint::Printer.table_print(Billy.proxy.requests, [\n      :status,\n      :handler,\n      :method,\n      { url: { width: 100 } },\n      :headers,\n      :body\n    ])\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis will generate a human readable list of all requests after each test run:\n\n```\nRequests received via Puffing Billy Proxy:\nSTATUS   | HANDLER | METHOD  | URL                                     | HEADERS                        | BODY\n---------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----\ncomplete | proxy   | GET     | http://127.0.0.1:56692/                 | {\"Accept\"=>\"text/html,appli... |\ncomplete | proxy   | GET     | http://127.0.0.1:56692/assets/appl...   | {\"Accept\"=>\"text/css,*/*;q=... |\ncomplete | proxy   | GET     | http://127.0.0.1:56692/assets/app...    | {\"Accept\"=>\"*/*\", \"Referer\"... |\ncomplete | proxy   | GET     | http://127.0.0.1:56692/javascript/index | {\"Accept\"=>\"text/html,appli... |\ncomplete | stubs   | OPTIONS | https://api.github.com:443/             | {\"Access-Control-Request-Me... |\ncomplete | stubs   | GET     | https://api.github.com:443/             | {\"Accept\"=>\"*/*\", \"Referer\"... |\ninflight |         | GET     | http://127.0.0.1:56692/example          | {\"Referer\"=>\"http://127.0.0... |\n.\n\nFinished in 1.98 seconds (files took 2.11 seconds to load)\n1 example, 0 failures\n```\n\nThe handler column indicates how Puffing Billy handled your request:\n\n- proxy: This request was successfully routed to the original target\n- stubs: This was handled via a stub\n- error: This request was not handled by a stub, and was not successfully handled\n- cache: This response was handled by a previous cache\n\nIf your `status` is set to `inflight` this request has not yet been handled fully. Either puffing billy crashed\ninternally on this request, or your test ended before it could complete successfully.\n\n`c.cache_request_body_methods` is used to specify HTTP methods of requests that you would like to cache separately based on the contents of the request body. The default is ['post'].\n\n`c.after_cache_handles_request` is used to configure a callback that can operate on the response after it has been retrieved from the cache but before it is returned. The callback receives the request and response as arguments, with a request object like: `{ method: method, url: url, headers: headers, body: body }`. An example usage would be manipulating the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header so that your test server doesn't always have to run on the same port in order to accept cached responses to CORS requests:\n\n```\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  ...\n  fix_cors_header = proc do |_request, response|\n    allowed_origins = response[:headers]['Access-Control-Allow-Origin']\n    if allowed_origins.present?\n      localhost_port_pattern = %r{(?<=http://127\\.0\\.0\\.1:)(\\d+)}\n      allowed_origins.sub!(\n        localhost_port_pattern, Capybara.current_session.server.port.to_s\n      )\n    end\n  end\n  c.after_cache_handles_request = fix_cors_header\n  ...\nend\n```\n\n`c.use_ignore_params` is used to choose whether to use the ignore_params blacklist or the allow_params whitelist. Set to `true` to use `c.ignore_params`,\n`false` to use `c.allow_params`\n\n`c.before_handle_request` is used to modify `method`, `url`, `headers`, `body` before handle request by `stubs`, `cache` or `proxy`. Method accept 4 argumens and must return array of this arguments:\n\n```\nc.before_handle_request = proc { |method, url, headers, body|\n  filtered_body = JSON.dump(filter_secret_data(JSON.load(body)))\n  [method, url, headers, filtered_body]\n}\n```\n\n`c.cache_simulates_network_delays` is used to add some delay before cache returns response. When set to `true`, cached requests will wait from configured delay time before responding. This allows to catch various race conditions in asynchronous front-end requests. The default is `false`.\n\n`c.cache_simulates_network_delay_time` is used to configure time (in seconds) to wait until responding from cache. The default is `0.1`.\n\n### Cache Scopes\n\nIf you need to cache different responses to the same HTTP request, you can use\ncache scoping.\n\nFor example, an index page may return zero or more items in a list, with or\nwithout pagination, depending on the number of entries in a database.\n\nThere are a few different ways to use cache scopes:\n\n```ruby\n# If you do nothing, it uses the default cache scope:\nit 'defaults to nil scope' do\n  expect(proxy.cache.scope).to be_nil\nend\n\n# You can change context indefinitely to a specific cache scope:\ncontext 'with a cache scope' do\n  before do\n    proxy.cache.scope_to \"my_cache\"\n  end\n\n  # Remember to set the cache scope back to the default in an after block\n  # within the context it is used, and/or at the global rails_helper level!\n  after do\n    proxy.cache.use_default_scope\n  end\n\n  it 'uses the cache scope' do\n    expect(proxy.cache.scope).to eq(\"my_cache\")\n  end\n\n  it 'can be reset to the default scope' do\n    proxy.cache.use_default_scope\n    expect(proxy.cache.scope).to be_nil\n  end\n\n  # Or you can run a block within the context of a cache scope:\n  # Note: When using scope blocks, be sure that both the action that triggers a\n  #       request and the assertion that a response has been received are within the block\n  it 'can execute a block against a named cache' do\n    expect(proxy.cache.scope).to eq(\"my_cache\")\n    proxy.cache.with_scope \"another_cache\" do\n      expect(proxy.cache.scope).to eq \"another_cache\"\n    end\n    # It\n    expect(proxy.cache.scope).to eq(\"my_cache\")\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIf you use named caches it is highly recommend that you use a global\nhook to set the cache back to the default before or after each test.\n\nIn Rspec:\n\n```ruby\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.before :each { proxy.cache.use_default_scope }\nend\n```\n\n## Separate Cache Directory for Each Test\nIf you want the cache for each test to be independent, i.e. have it's own directory where the cache files are stored, you can do so.\n\n### in Cucumber\n\nuse a `Before` tag:\n```rb\nBefore('@javascript') do |scenario, block|\n  Billy.configure do |c|\n    feature_name = scenario.feature.name.underscore\n    scenario_name = scenario.name.underscore\n    c.cache_path = \"features/support/fixtures/req_cache/#{feature_name}/#{scenario_name}/\"\n    FileUtils.mkdir_p(Billy.config.cache_path) unless File.exist?(Billy.config.cache_path)\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### in Rspec\n\nuse a `before(:each)` block:\n\n```rb\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  base_cache_path = Billy.config.cache_path\n  base_certs_path = Billy.config.certs_path\n  config.before :each do |x|\n    feature_name = x.metadata[:example_group][:description].underscore.gsub(' ', '_')\n    scenario_name = x.metadata[:description].underscore.gsub(' ', '_')\n    Billy.configure do |c|\n      cache_scenario_folder_path = \"#{base_cache_path}/#{feature_name}/#{scenario_name}/\"\n      FileUtils.mkdir_p(cache_scenario_folder_path) unless File.exist?(cache_scenario_folder_path)\n      c.cache_path = cache_scenario_folder_path\n\n      certs_scenario_folder_path = \"#{base_certs_path}/#{feature_name}/#{scenario_name}/\"\n      FileUtils.mkdir_p(certs_scenario_folder_path) unless File.exist?(certs_scenario_folder_path)\n      c.certs_path = certs_scenario_folder_path\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Stub requests recording\n\nIf you want to record requests to stubbed URIs, set the following configuration option:\n\n```ruby\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.record_stub_requests = true\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```ruby\nit 'should intercept a GET request' do\n  stub = proxy.stub('http://example.com/')\n  visit 'http://example.com/'\n  expect(stub.has_requests?).to be true\n  expect(stub.requests).not_to be_empty\nend\n```\n\n## Proxy timeouts\n\nBy default, the Puffing Billy proxy will use the EventMachine:HttpRequest timeouts of 5 seconds\nfor connect and 10 seconds for inactivity when talking to downstream servers.\n\nThese can be configured as follows:\n\n```ruby\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.proxied_request_connect_timeout = 20\n  c.proxied_request_inactivity_timeout = 20\nend\n```\n\n## Customising the javascript driver\n\nIf you use a customised Capybara driver, remember to set the proxy address\nand tell it to ignore SSL certificate warnings. See\n[lib/billy.rb](https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy/blob/master/lib/billy.rb)\nto see how Billy's default drivers are configured.\n\n## Working with VCR and Webmock\n\nIf you use VCR and Webmock elsewhere in your specs, you may need to disable them\nfor your specs utilizing Puffing Billy. To do so, you can configure your `rails_helper.rb`\nas shown below:\n\n```ruby\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.around(:each, type: :feature) do |example|\n    WebMock.allow_net_connect!\n    VCR.turned_off { example.run }\n    WebMock.disable_net_connect!\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAs an alternative if you're using VCR, you can ignore requests coming from the browser.\nOne way of doing that is by adding to your `rails_helper.rb` the excerpt below:\n\n```ruby\nVCR.configure do |config|\n  config.ignore_request do |request|\n    request.headers.include?('Referer')\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNote that this approach may cause unexpected behavior if your backend sends the Referer HTTP header (which is unlikely).\n\n### Raising errors from stubs\n\nBy default Puffing Billy suppresses errors from stub-blocks.\nTo make it raise errors instead, add this test initializers:\n\n```ruby\nEM.error_handler { |e| raise e }\n```\n\n## SSL usage\n\nUnfortunately we cannot setup the runtime certificate authority on your browser\nat time of configuring the Capybara driver.  So you need to take care of this\nstep yourself as a prepartion. A good point would be directly after configuring\nthis gem.\n\n### Google Chrome Headless example\n\nGoogle Chrome/Chromium is capable to run as a test browser with the new\nheadless mode which is not able to handle the deprecated\n`--ignore-certificate-errors` flag. But the headless mode is capable of\nhandling the user PKI certificate store.  So you just need to import the\nruntime Puffing Billy certificate authority on your system store, or generate a\nnew store for your current session. The following examples demonstrates the\nformer variant:\n\n```ruby\n# Install the fabulous `os` gem first\n# See: https://rubygems.org/gems/os\n# gem install os\n#\n# --\n\n# Overwrite the local home directory for chrome. We use this\n# to setup a custom SSL certificate store.\nENV['HOME'] = \"#{Dir.tmpdir}/chrome-home-#{Time.now.to_i}\"\n\n# Clear and recreate the Chrome home directory.\nFileUtils.rm_rf(ENV['HOME'])\nFileUtils.mkdir_p(ENV['HOME'])\n\n# Setup a new pki certificate database for Chrome\nif OS.linux?\n  system <<~SCRIPT\n    cd \"#{ENV['HOME']}\"\n    curl -s -k -o \"cacert-root.crt\" \"http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt\"\n    curl -s -k -o \"cacert-class3.crt\" \"http://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt\"\n    echo > .password\n    mkdir -p .pki/nssdb\n    CERT_DIR=sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb\n    certutil -N -d .pki/nssdb -f .password\n    certutil -d ${CERT_DIR}  -A -t TC \\\n      -n \"CAcert.org\" -i cacert-root.crt\n    certutil -d ${CERT_DIR} -A -t TC \\\n      -n \"CAcert.org Class 3\" -i cacert-class3.crt\n    certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A \\\n      -n puffing-billy -t \"CT,C,C\" -i #{Billy.certificate_authority.cert_file}\n  SCRIPT\nend\n\n# Setup the macOS certificate store\nif OS.mac?\n  prompt = 'Add Puffing Billy root certificate authority ' \\\n           'to system certificate store'\n  system <<~SCRIPT\n    sudo -p \"# #{prompt}`echo $'\\nPassword: '`\" \\\n      security find-certificate -a -Z -c 'Puffing Billy' \\\n      | grep 'SHA-1 hash' | cut -d ':' -f2 | xargs -n1 \\\n      sudo security delete-certificate -Z >/dev/null 2>&1 || true\n    sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \\\n      -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \\\n      #{Billy.certificate_authority.cert_file}\n  SCRIPT\nend\n```\n\nMind the reset of the `HOME` environment variable. Fortunately Chrome takes\ncare of the users home, so we can setup a new temporary directory for the test\nrun, without messing with potential user configurations.\n\nThe macOS support requires the input of your password to manipulate the system\ncertificate store. If you are lazy you can turn off sudo password prompt for\nthe security command, but it's strongly advised against. (You know passwordless\nsecurity, is no security in this case) Further, the macOS handling here cleans\nup old Puffing Billy root certificate authorities and put the current one into\nthe system store. So after a run of your the suite only one certificate will be\nleft over. If this is not enough you can handling the cleanup again with a\ncustom on-after hook.\n\n### TLS hostname validation\n\nem-http-request was modified to emit a warning if being used without the TLS\n``verify_peer`` option.  Puffing Billy defaults to specifying ``verify_peer: false``\nbut you can now modify configuration to do peer verification. So if you've\ngone to the trouble of setting up your own certificate authority and self-signed\ncerts you can enable it like so:\n\n```ruby\nBilly.configure do |c|\n  c.verify_peer = true\nend\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Bring Ruby VCR to Javascript testing with Capybara and puffing-billy](https://dzone.com/articles/bring-ruby-vcr-javascript)\n* [Clean-up unused cache files periodically with this config](https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy/pull/26#issuecomment-29905030)\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

Store type\n2.  Store title that user sees\n3.  Icon of store that user sees\n4.  An url to show the user if the store is not installed in user's device\n5.  Package name of your application\n\n#### or you can omit adding some properties in Kotlin\n\n```kotlin\nlist.add(UpdaterStoreList(Store.GOOGLE_PLAY, \"Download From Google Play\", packageName = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID))\n```\n\n### Available stores\n\nthis library currently supports only these markets:\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com)\n\n[CafeBazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir)\n\n[IranApps](https://iranapps.ir)\n\n[Myket](https://myket.ir/)\n\nTo Select an Store you should use:\n\n```kotlin\nStore.GOOGLE_PLAY\nStore.CAFE_BAZAAR\nStore.MYKET\nStore.IRAN_APPS\n```\n\n### Direct Download\n\nyou can also make as many direct APK download links as you need.\nUsers can download that APK directly on their phone, and after downloading finishes, the install page will be shown to the user.\n\n#### Remember to put WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, INTERNET and REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permissions in your manifest. The library asks these permissions at runtime if needed\n\n```kotlin\nlist.add(UpdaterStoreList(Store.DIRECT_URL, \"Direct Download\",R.mipmap.ic_launcher , \"https://cafebazaar.ir/download/bazaar.apk\", BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID))\n```\n\n### To Show UpdateDialog\n\n```kotlin\nAppUpdaterDialog.getInstance(\"New Update!!!!\", \"Lots of new features!! upgrade yo the new version.\", list, true, font).show(supportFragmentManager, \"TAG\")\n```\n\nparameters as the order you see in above line:\n\n1.  Update dialog title\n2.  Update dialog description\n3.  List of stores you created in last step\n4.  Is it a force update? (should dialog be cancelable or not)\n5.  Typeface to customize font style\n\n### To change library's texts\n\nIn strings file, add these lines:\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n<string name=\"please_wait\">Please wait</string>\n<string name=\"downloading_new_version\">Downloading new version...</string>\n<string name=\"download_notification_title\">Downloading...</string>\n<string name=\"download_notification_description\">Downloading new version</string>\n<string name=\"please_install\">Please install</string>\n<string name=\"or\">or</string>\n<string name=\"download_from_store\">Download from store</string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n### To use default icons\n\nI have added default icons of Iranian stores in the app.\nif you like to use them, you can find them like :\n\n```text\nR.drawable.appupdater_ic_google_play\nR.drawable.appupdater_ic_bazar\nR.drawable.appupdater_ic_myket\nR.drawable.appupdater_ic_iran_apps\n```\n\n## Kotlin DSL\n\n### Adding Stores in DSL\n\nyou can show users as many stores as you need, to download your application from there. to make a new store:\n\n```kotlin\nstore {\n       store = Store.DIRECT_URL\n       title = \"Direct Download 2\"\n       icon = R.mipmap.ic_launcher\n       url = \"https://cafebazaar.ir/download/bazaar.apk\"\n       packageName = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID\n        }\n```\n\n### Showing UpdateDialog in DSL\n\n```kotlin\n updateDialogBuilder {\n            title = \"New Update !\"\n            description = \"Lots of new features! Update right now\"\n            isForceUpdate = false\n            typeface = Typeface.createFromAsset(assets, FONT_PATH)\n            list = listOf(\n                store {\n                    store = Store.DIRECT_URL\n                    title = \"Direct Download 1\"\n                    icon = R.mipmap.ic_launcher\n                    url = \"https://cafebazaar.ir/download/bazaar.apk\"\n                    packageName = BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID\n                })\n                }.show(supportFragmentManager, TAG)\n```\n\nYou can see the demo application to learn more about the usage.\n\n## Download\n\n### Adding the dependency\n\nAdd this to your root *build.gradle* file:\n\n```groovy\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow add the dependency to your app build.gradle file:\n\n```groovy\nimplementation 'com.github.SirLordPouya:AndroidAppUpdater:latest_version'\n```\n\n## License\n\n```text\nLoadingFragment is released under the Apache License 2.0.

When running Bitpay Wallet in a normal browser environment, browser extensions and other malicious code might have access to internal data and private keys. For production use, see the latest official [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/releases/).\n\nClone the repo and open the directory:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/bitpay/wallet.git\ncd wallet\n```\n\nEnsure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install and start Wallet:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run start\n```\n\nVisit [`localhost:8100`](http://localhost:8100/) to view the app.\n\n## Unit & E2E Tests (Karma & Protractor)\n\nTo run the tests, run:\n\n```\n npm run test\n```\n\n## Testing on Real Devices\n\nIt's recommended that all final testing be done on a real device – both to assess performance and to enable features that are unavailable to the emulator (e.g. a device camera).\n\n### Android\n\nFollow the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/) to set up your development environment.\n\nWhen your development environment is ready, run the `start:android` package script.\n\n```sh\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run prepare:bitpay\nnpm run start:android\n```\n\n### iOS\n\nFollow the [Cordova iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/) to set up your development environment.\n\nWhen your development environment is ready, run the `start:ios` package script.\n\n```sh\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run prepare:bitpay\nnpm run start:ios\n```\n\n### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)\n\nThe desktop version of Bitpay Wallet currently uses Electron. To get started, first install Electron on your system from [the Electron website](https://electronjs.org/).\n\nWhen Electron is installed, run the `start:desktop` package script.\n\n```sh\nnpm run apply:wallet\nnpm run start:desktop\n```\n\n## Build Bitpay Wallet App Bundles\n\nBefore building the release version for a platform, run the `clean-all` command to delete any untracked files in your current working directory. (Be sure to stash any uncommitted changes you've made.) This guarantees consistency across builds for the current state of this repository.\n\nThe `final` commands build the production version of the app, and bundle it with the release version of the platform being built.\n\n### Android\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean-all\nnpm install\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run prepare:bitpay\nnpm run final:android\n```\n\n### iOS\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean-all\nnpm install\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run prepare:bitpay\nnpm run final:ios\n```\n\n### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)\n\n```sh\nnpm run clean-all\nnpm install\nnpm run apply:bitpay\nnpm run final:desktop\n```\n\n## Desktop Data Path\n\nPer-user application data directory for BitPay distribution.\n\n```sh\n\"~/Library/Containers/com.bitpay.wallet.desktop/Data/.bitpay\"\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Enable External Services\n\nTo enable external services, set the `BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION` environment variable to the location of your configuration before running the `apply` task.\n\n```sh\nBITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION=\"~/.bitpay/externalServices.json\" npm run apply:bitpay\n```\n\n## About Bitpay Wallet\n\n### General\n\nBitpay Wallet (formerly Copay) implements a multisig wallet using [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) addresses. It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3. To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, Bitpay Wallet requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants. Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet. Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.\n\nTo unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction. The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.). Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally. Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitpay Wallet also implements [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) to generate new addresses for peers. The public key that each participant contributes to the wallet is a BIP32 extended public key. As additional public keys are needed for wallet operations (to produce new addresses to receive payments into the wallet, for example) new public keys can be derived from the participants' original extended public keys. Once again, it's important to stress that each participant keeps their own private keys locally - private keys are not shared - and are used to sign transaction proposals to make payments from the shared wallet.\n\nFor more information regarding how addresses are generated using this procedure, see: [Structure for Deterministic P2SH Multisignature Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki).\n\n## Bitpay Wallet Backups and Recovery\n\nSince v1.2 Bitpay Wallet uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets. The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.\n\nInformation about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/blob/master/backupRecovery.md\n\nPrevious versions of Bitpay Wallet used files as backups. See the following section.\n\nIt is possible to recover funds from a Bitpay Wallet Wallet without using Bitpay Wallet or the Wallet Service, check the [Copay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery/tree/master).\n\n## Wallet Export Format\n\nBitpay Wallet encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). To extract the private key of your wallet you can go to settings, choose your wallet, click in \"more options\", then \"wallet information\", scroll to the bottom and click in \"Extended Private Key\". That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!\n\nThe backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.\nDepending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using\n[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in Copay v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since Copay version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):\n\n| Copay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |\n| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |\n| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |\n| ≥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |\n| ≥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |\n| ≥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48’)  | P2SH         |\n\nUsing a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.\n\nBIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so Copay address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.\n\nSince version 1.5, Copay uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the other copayers extended public keys.\n\n## Bitcore Wallet Service\n\nBitpay Wallet depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and Copayer synchronization. A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`. Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within Bitpay Wallet. BWS also allows Bitpay Wallet to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).\n\nPlease note that Bitpay Wallet v5.3.0 and above use CSP to restrict network access. To use a custom BWS see [CSP announcement](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/CSP.md).\n\n## Translations\n\nBitpay Wallet uses standard gettext PO files for translations and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/copay) as the front-end tool for translators. To join our team of translators, please create an account at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and translate the Bitpay Wallet documentation and application text into your native language.\n\nTo download and build using the latest translations from Crowdin, please use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ncd i18n\nnode crowdin_download.js\n```\n\nThis will download all partial and complete language translations while also cleaning out any untranslated ones.\n\n**Translation Credits:**\n\n- Japanese: @dabura667\n- French: @kirvx\n- Portuguese: @pmichelazzo\n- Spanish: @cmgustavo\n- German: @saschad\n- Russian: @vadim0\n\n_Gracias totales!_\n\n## Release Schedules\n\nBitpay Wallet uses the `MAJOR.MINOR.BATCH` convention for versioning. Any release that adds features should modify the MINOR or MAJOR number.\n\n### Bug Fixing Releases\n\nWe release bug fixes as soon as possible for all platforms. Usually around a week after patches, a new release is made with language translation updates (like 1.1.4 and then 1.1.5). There is no coordination so all platforms are updated at the same time.\n\n### Minor and Major Releases\n\n- t+0: tag the release 1.2 and \"text lock\" (meaning only non-text related bug fixes. Though this rule is sometimes broken, it's good to make a rule.)\n- t+7: testing for 1.2 is finished, translation is also finished, and 1.2.1 is tagged with all translations along with bug fixes made in the last week.\n- t+7: iOS is submitted for 1.2.1. All other platforms are submitted with auto-release off.\n- t + (~17): All platforms 1.2.1 are released when Apple approves the iOS application update.\n\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to contribute. Please take a moment to\nreview the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n- [Bug reports](CONTRIBUTING.md#bugs)\n- [Feature requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#features)\n- [Pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)\n\n## Current Active Developers GPG keys ID\n\n- 15EDAD8D9F2EB1AF @cmgustavo\n\n- FC283098DA862864 @gabrielbazan7\n\n- DD6D7EAADE12280D @Gamboster\n\n- D87947CC8A32D91C @msalcala11\n\n- 612C9C4DDAC47B61 @rastajpa\n\n- F8FC1D9B1B46486D @matiu\n\n## Support\n\nPlease see [Support requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#support)\n\n## License\n\nBitpay Wallet is released under the MIT License.

    "text" : "# AeroGear OAuth2 Cordova\nThe plugin handles OAuth2 *authorization code grant* in a secure manner. The OAuth2 dance uses external browser approach, OAuth2 access and refresh tokens are stored securely encrypted in your native device. Supports iOS, android and windows phone platforms.\n\nThe plugin wraps the following libs:\n\n* [aerogear-ios-oauth2](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-oauth2)\n* [aerogear-android-authz](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-authz)\n\nIf you want to see the plugin in action please refer to [aerogear-cordova-cookbook]() Shoot'nShare demo app or/ad just follow the Getting started guide to create your own.\n\n|                 | Project Info  |\n| --------------- | ------------- |\n| License:        | Apache License, Version 2.0  |\n| Build:          | Cordova Plugin  |\n| Documentation:  | https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-cordova/  |\n| Issue tracker:  | https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGCORDOVA  |\n| Mailing lists:  | [aerogear-users](http://aerogear-users.1116366.n5.nabble.com/) ([subscribe](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-users))  |\n|                 | [aerogear-dev](http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/) ([subscribe](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-dev))  |\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe Cordova command line tooling is based on node.js so first you’ll need to install node then you can install Cordova by executing:\n\n\t$ npm install -g cordova\n\nTo deploy on iOS you need to install the ios-deploy package as well\n\n\t$ npm install -g ios-deploy\n\n### Create the App\n\nCreate a new app by executing:\n\n\t$ cordova create <project-name> [app-id] [app-name]\n\n### Add platform(s)\n\nSpecify a set of target platforms by executing:\n\n\t$ cordova platform add <platform>\n\nThe available platform values are ios and android.\n\n### Install the plugin\n\nInstall the aerogear-oauth2-cordova plugin by executing:\n\n\t$ cordova plugin add aerogear-cordova-oauth2\n\n### Sample example\n\nIn `wwww/js/index.js` file, to start the OAuth2 dance as soon as `onDeviceReady` event is fired, add the following snippet:\n\n```javascript\n  onDeviceReady: function () {\n    app.receivedEvent('deviceready');\n    oauth2.addGoogle({\n      name: 'gplus',\n      settings: {\n        clientId: \"617285928032-nnkcrot1827fmd738pug6clbqlgosffs.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n        scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'\n      }\n    });\n\n    oauth2.addKeycloak({\n      name: 'keycloak',\n      settings: {\n        base: 'http://192.168.1.15:8080/auth',\n        clientId: 'shoot-third-party',\n        realm: \"shoot-realm\"\n      }\n    });\n\n    oauth2.addFacebook({\n      name: 'facebook',\n      settings: {\n        clientId: '1511044619160050',\n        clientSecret: '3b08052d3d96e2120f2c53a36eebd02f',\n        scopes: 'photo_upload, publish_actions'\n      }\n    });\n\n    oauth2.gplus.requestAccess()\n      .then(function (token) {\n        console.log(token);\n        // add token to the http header on futher http requests:\n        // 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token\n      }, function (err) {\n        alert(err.error);\n      });\n  },\n```\n\n### Google Play Services\nOn Android you can use Google Play Services to retrieve an Oauth2 token using on of the device's authorized accounts.\nTo make the Google Play Services available to your application, be sure to add the `com.google.playservices` cordova plugin to your project.\nThen request an Oauth2 token using Google Play Services as in this example:\n```javascript\n   oauth2.requestAccessUsingPlayServices({\n        scopes: 'openid',\n        accountTypes: 'com.google'\n     })\n     .then( function( accessToken ){\n        ...\n     })\n     .catch( function( error ) {\n        // an error happened\n     });\n   });\n```\n\n### Facebook iOS\n\nFor our OAuth2 on iOS plugin we use external browser approach, in order to re-enter the app you need to provide a URI schema. This is called the ```redirect_uri```. By convention Google uses your iOS bundle. Facebook uses as ```redirect_uri``` 2 letters ```fb``` followed by the ```client_id```. As the ```client_id``` is not in your config.xml, once the project is deployed you will have to go to [project_name]-info.plist and modify it to change fbYYY where YYY is your facebook ```client_id```.\n\n## Xcode\n\nWhen you need / want to build the project with Xcode you'll need to make [some changes to the project](xcode.md)\n\n## Todo\n\nThis is a very early version:\n- expose refreshToken, revokeToken\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more details about the current release, please consult [our documentation](https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-cordova/).\n\n## Development\n\nIf you would like to help develop AeroGear you can join our [developer's mailing list](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-dev), join #aerogear on Freenode, or shout at us on Twitter @aerogears.\n\nAlso takes some time and skim the [contributor guide](http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/Contributing/)\n\n## Questions?\n\nJoin our [user mailing list](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-users) for any questions or help! We really hope you enjoy app development with AeroGear!\n\n## Found a bug?\n\nIf you found a bug please create a ticket for us on [Jira](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGCORDOVA) with some steps to reproduce it.\n"

If it does than there is not much that I can help you with. You can either stick with selinux disabled (not recommended by redhat) or switch to using ubuntu.\n\nIf using the latest docker version and/or disabling selinux does not fix the issue then please file a issue request on the [issues](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/issues) page.\n\nIn your issue report please make sure you provide the following information:\n\n- The host distribution and release version.\n- Output of the `docker version` command.\n- Output of the `docker info` command.\n- The `docker run` command you used to run the image (mask out the sensitive bits).\n\n# Installation\n\nAutomated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/redmine) and is the recommended method of installation.\n\n> **Note**: Builds are also available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/redmine)\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/redmine:latest\n```\n\nSince version `2.4.2`, the image builds are being tagged. You can now pull a particular version of redmine by specifying the version number. For example,\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nAlternately you can build the image yourself.\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t sameersbn/redmine github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine\n```\n\n# Quick Start\n\nThe quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/master/docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nAlternately, you can manually launch the `redmine` container and the supporting `postgresql` container by following this two step guide.\n\nStep 1. Launch a postgresql container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=postgresql-redmine -d \\\n  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \\\n  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \\\n  sameersbn/postgresql:9.6-4\n```\n\nStep 2. Launch the redmine container\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d \\\n  --link=postgresql-redmine:postgresql --publish=10083:80 \\\n  --env='REDMINE_PORT=10083' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n**NOTE**: Please allow a minute or two for the Redmine application to start.\n\nPoint your browser to `http://localhost:10083` and login using the default username and password:\n\n* username: **admin**\n* password: **admin**\n\nMake sure you visit the `Administration` link and `Load the default configuration` before creating any projects.\n\nYou now have the Redmine application up and ready for testing. If you want to use this image in production the please read on.\n\n*The rest of the document will use the docker command line. You can quite simply adapt your configuration into a `docker-compose.yml` file if you wish to do so.*\n\n# Configuration\n\n## Data Store\n\nFor the file storage we need to mount a volume at the following location.\n\n* `/home/redmine/data`\n* `/var/log/redmine` for server logs\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> Existing users **need to move** the existing files directory inside `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/`.\n>\n> ```bash\n> mkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine\n> mv /opt/redmine/files /srv/docker/redmine/redmine\n> ```\n\nSELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine\nsudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/redmine\n```\n\nVolumes can be mounted in docker by specifying the **'-v'** option in the docker run command.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n## Database\n\nRedmine uses a database backend to store its data.\n\n### MySQL\n\n#### Internal MySQL Server\n\nThe internal mysql server has been removed from the image. Please use a linked [mysql](#linking-to-mysql-container) or [postgresql](#linking-to-postgresql-container) container instead or connect with an external [mysql](#external-mysql-server) or [postgresql](#external-postgresql-server) server.\n\nIf you have been using the internal mysql server follow these instructions to migrate to a linked mysql container:\n\nAssuming that your mysql data is available at `/srv/docker/redmine/mysql`\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=mysql-redmine -d \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \\\n  sameersbn/mysql:5.7.22-1\n```\n\nThis will start a mysql container with your existing mysql data. Now login to the mysql container and create a user for the existing `redmine_production` database.\n\nAll you need to do now is link this mysql container to the redmine container using the `--link=mysql-redmine:mysql` option and provide the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` parameters.\n\nRefer to [Linking to MySQL Container](#linking-to-mysql-container) for more information.\n\n#### External MySQL Server\n\nThe image can be configured to use an external MySQL database instead of starting a MySQL server internally. The database configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the Redmine image.\n\nBefore you start the Redmine image create user and database for redmine.\n\n```sql\nmysql -uroot -p\nCREATE USER 'redmine'@'%.%.%.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `redmine_production` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET `utf8` COLLATE `utf8_unicode_ci`;\nGRANT SELECT, LOCK TABLES, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER ON `redmine_production`.* TO 'redmine'@'%.%.%.%';\n```\n\nWe are now ready to start the redmine application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --env='DB_ADAPTER=mysql2' \\\n  --env='DB_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \\\n  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nThis will initialize the redmine database and after a couple of minutes your redmine instance should be ready to use.\n\n#### Linking to MySQL Container\n\nYou can link this image with a mysql container for the database requirements. The alias of the mysql server container should be set to **mysql** while linking with the redmine image.\n\nIf a mysql container is linked, only the `DB_ADAPTER`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` settings are automatically retrieved using the linkage. You may still need to set other database connection parameters such as the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and so on.\n\nTo illustrate linking with a mysql container, we will use the [sameersbn/mysql](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-mysql) image. When using docker-mysql in production you should mount a volume for the mysql data store. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-mysql/blob/master/README.md) of docker-mysql for details.\n\nFirst, lets pull the mysql image from the docker index.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/mysql:5.7.22-1\n```\n\nFor data persistence lets create a store for the mysql and start the container.\n\nSELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/mysql\nsudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/mysql\n```\n\nThe run command looks like this.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=mysql-redmine -d \\\n  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \\\n  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/mysql:/var/lib/mysql \\\n  sameersbn/mysql:5.7.22-1\n```\n\nThe above command will create a database named `redmine_production` and also create a user named `redmine` with the password `password` with full/remote access to the `redmine_production` database.\n\nWe are now ready to start the redmine application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=mysql-redmine:mysql \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nHere the image will also automatically fetch the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` variables from the mysql container as they are specified in the `docker run` command for the mysql container. This is made possible using the magic of docker links and works with the following images:\n\n - [mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)\n - [sameersbn/mysql](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/mysql/)\n - [centurylink/mysql](https://hub.docker.com/r/centurylink/mysql/)\n - [orchardup/mysql](https://hub.docker.com/r/orchardup/mysql/)\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\n#### External PostgreSQL Server\n\nThe image also supports using an external PostgreSQL Server. This is also controlled via environment variables.\n\n```sql\nCREATE ROLE redmine with LOGIN CREATEDB PASSWORD 'password';\nCREATE DATABASE redmine_production;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE redmine_production to redmine;\n```\n\nWe are now ready to start the redmine application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --env='DB_ADAPTER=postgresql' \\\n  --env='DB_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \\\n  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nThis will initialize the redmine database and after a couple of minutes your redmine instance should be ready to use.\n\n#### Linking to PostgreSQL Container\n\nYou can link this image with a postgresql container for the database requirements. The alias of the postgresql server container should be set to **postgresql** while linking with the redmine image.\n\nIf a postgresql container is linked, only the `DB_ADAPTER`, `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` settings are automatically retrieved using the linkage. You may still need to set other database connection parameters such as the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` and so on.\n\nTo illustrate linking with a postgresql container, we will use the [sameersbn/postgresql](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql) image. When using postgresql image in production you should mount a volume for the postgresql data store. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-postgresql/blob/master/README.md) of docker-postgresql for details.\n\nFirst, lets pull the postgresql image from the docker index.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/postgresql:9.6-4\n```\n\nFor data persistence lets create a store for the postgresql and start the container.\n\nSELinux users are also required to change the security context of the mount point so that it plays nicely with selinux.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/postgresql\nsudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/redmine/postgresql\n```\n\nThe run command looks like this.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=postgresql-redmine -d \\\n  --env='DB_NAME=redmine_production' \\\n  --env='DB_USER=redmine' --env='DB_PASS=password' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql \\\n  sameersbn/postgresql:9.6-4\n```\n\nThe above command will create a database named `redmine_production` and also create a user named `redmine` with the password `password` with access to the `redmine_production` database.\n\nWe are now ready to start the redmine application.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=postgresql-redmine:postgresql \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nHere the image will also automatically fetch the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS` variables from the postgresql container as they are specified in the `docker run` command for the postgresql container. This is made possible using the magic of docker links and works with the following images:\n\n - [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)\n - [sameersbn/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/postgresql/)\n - [orchardup/postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/r/orchardup/postgresql/)\n - [paintedfox/postgresql](https://hub.docker.com/r/paintedfox/postgresql/)\n\n## Memcached (Optional)\n\nThis image can (optionally) be configured to use a memcached server to speed up Redmine. This is particularly useful when you have a large number users.\n\n### External Memcached Server\n\nThe image can be configured to use an external memcached server. The memcached server host and port configuration should be specified using environment variables `MEMCACHE_HOST` and `MEMCACHE_PORT` like so:\n\n*Assuming that the memcached server host is 192.168.1.100*\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --env='MEMCACHE_HOST=192.168.1.100' --env='MEMCACHE_PORT=11211' \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n### Linking to Memcached Container\n\nAlternately you can link this image with a memcached container. The alias of the memcached server container should be set to **memcached** while linking with the redmine image.\n\nTo illustrate linking with a memcached container, we will use the [sameersbn/memcached](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-memcached) image. Please refer the [README](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-memcached/blob/master/README.md) of docker-memcached for details.\n\nFirst, lets pull and launch the memcached image from the docker index.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=memcached-redmine -d sameersbn/memcached:1.5.6\n```\n\nNow you can link memcached to the redmine image:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm --link=memcached-redmine:memcached \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n### Mail\n\nThe mail configuration should be specified using environment variables while starting the redmine image. The configuration defaults to using gmail to send emails and requires the specification of a valid username and password to login to the gmail servers.\n\nPlease refer the [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) section for the list of SMTP parameters that can be specified.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --env='SMTP_USER=USER@gmail.com' --env='SMTP_PASS=PASSWORD' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nIf you are not using google mail, then please configure the SMTP host and port using the `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_PORT` configuration parameters.\n\nIf you are using a google apps account with a custom domain (other than google.com), you need to set the `SMTP_DOMAIN` parameters or else you will get internal server error when doing an action that would normally send a mail.\n\nSimilary you can configure receiving emails using the `IMAP_` configuration options. Please refer [Available Configuration Parameters](#available-configuration-parameters) for details. When receiving emails is enabled users can comment on issues by replying to emails.\n\n*P.S. The receiving emails feature is only available since versions `2.6.6-2`, `3.0.4-2` and `3.1.0-2`. Refer the [Changelog](Changelog.md) for details.*\n\n### SSL\n\nAccess to the redmine application can be secured using SSL so as to prevent unauthorized access. While a CA certified SSL certificate allows for verification of trust via the CA, a self signed certificates can also provide an equal level of trust verification as long as each client takes some additional steps to verify the identity of your website. I will provide instructions on achieving this towards the end of this section.\n\nTo secure your application via SSL you basically need two things:\n- **Private key (.key)**\n- **SSL certificate (.crt)**\n\nWhen using CA certified certificates, these files are provided to you by the CA. When using self-signed certificates you need to generate these files yourself. Skip the following section if you are armed with CA certified SSL certificates.\n\nJump to the [Using HTTPS with a load balancer](#using-https-with-a-load-balancer) section if you are using a load balancer such as hipache, haproxy or nginx.\n\n#### Generation of Self Signed Certificates\n\nGeneration of self-signed SSL certificates involves a simple 3 step procedure.\n\n**STEP 1**: Create the server private key\n\n```bash\nopenssl genrsa -out redmine.key 2048\n```\n\n**STEP 2**: Create the certificate signing request (CSR)\n\n```bash\nopenssl req -new -key redmine.key -out redmine.csr\n```\n\n**STEP 3**: Sign the certificate using the private key and CSR\n\n```bash\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in redmine.csr -signkey redmine.key -out redmine.crt\n```\n\nCongratulations! you have now generated an SSL certificate thats valid for 365 days.\n\n#### Strengthening the server security\n\nThis section provides you with instructions to [strengthen your server security](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html). To achieve this we need to generate stronger DHE parameters.\n\n```bash\nopenssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048\n```\n\n#### Installation of the SSL Certificates\n\nOut of the four files generated above, we need to install the `redmine.key`, `redmine.crt` and `dhparam.pem` files at the redmine server. The CSR file is not needed, but do make sure you safely backup the file (in case you ever need it again).\n\nThe default path that the redmine application is configured to look for the SSL certificates is at `/home/redmine/data/certs`, this can however be changed using the `SSL_KEY_PATH`, `SSL_CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `SSL_DHPARAM_PATH` configuration options.\n\nIf you remember from above, the `/home/redmine/data` path is the path of the [data store](#data-store), which means that we have to create a folder named certs inside `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/` and copy the files into it and as a measure of security we will update the permission on the `redmine.key` file to only be readable by the owner.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs\ncp redmine.key /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/\ncp redmine.crt /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/\ncp dhparam.pem /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/\nchmod 400 /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/certs/redmine.key\n```\n\nGreat! we are now just one step away from having our application secured.\n\n#### Enabling HTTPS support\n\nHTTPS support can be enabled by setting the `REDMINE_HTTPS` option to `true`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d \\\n  --publish=10083:80 --publish 10445:443 \\\n  --env='REDMINE_PORT=10445' --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nIn this configuration, any requests made over the plain http protocol will automatically be redirected to use the https protocol. However, this is not optimal when using a load balancer.\n\nNote: If startup prints ```SSL keys and certificates were not found.``` refer to [SSL](#ssl) and verify you put the certs in the correct place.  Unless your trying to setup for [Using HTTPS with a load balancer](#using-https-with-a-load-balancer)\n\n#### Configuring HSTS\n\nHSTS if supported by the browsers makes sure that your users will only reach your server via HTTPS. When the user comes for the first time it sees a header from the server which states for how long from now this site should only be reachable via HTTPS - that's the HSTS max-age value.\n\nWith `NGINX_HSTS_MAXAGE` you can configure that value. The default value is `31536000` seconds. If you want to disable a already sent HSTS MAXAGE value, set it to `0`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d \\\n  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \\\n  --env='NGINX_HSTS_MAXAGE=2592000'\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nIf you want to completely disable HSTS set `NGINX_HSTS_ENABLED` to `false`.\n\n#### Using HTTPS with a load balancer\n\nLoad balancers like nginx/haproxy/hipache talk to backend applications over plain http and as such the installation of ssl keys and certificates are not required and should **NOT** be installed in the container. The SSL configuration has to instead be done at the load balancer. Hoewever, when using a load balancer you **MUST** set `REDMINE_HTTPS` to `true`.\n\nWith this in place, you should configure the load balancer to support handling of https requests. But that is out of the scope of this document. Please refer to [Using SSL/HTTPS with HAProxy](http://seanmcgary.com/posts/using-sslhttps-with-haproxy) for information on the subject.\n\nWhen using a load balancer, you probably want to make sure the load balancer performs the automatic http to https redirection. Information on this can also be found in the link above.\n\nIn summation, when using a load balancer, the docker command would look for the most part something like this:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d --publish=10083:80 \\\n  --env='REDMINE_HTTPS=true' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n### Deploy to a subdirectory (relative url root)\n\nBy default redmine expects that your application is running at the root (eg. /). This section explains how to run your application inside a directory.\n\nLet's assume we want to deploy our application to '/redmine'. Redmine needs to know this directory to generate the appropriate routes. This can be specified using the `REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` configuration option like so:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d --publish=10083:80 \\\n  --env='REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/redmine' \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\nRedmine will now be accessible at the `/redmine` path, e.g. `http://www.example.com/redmine`.\n\n**Note**: *The `REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` parameter should always begin with a slash and **SHOULD NOT** have any trailing slashes.*\n\n### Apache Proxy as frontend\n\nRef #370\n\nApache config\n```\n# REDMINE Pass connections to docker\nProxyRequests Off\nProxyPass /redmine http://127.0.0.1:10083/redmine/\nProxyPassReverse /redmine http://127.0.0.1:10083/redmine/\n```\n\nNote the following should be set: ```REDMINE_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/redmine```  and port mapped ```--publish=10083:80```\n\n### Mapping host user and group\n\nPer default the container is configured to run redmine as user and group `redmine` with `uid` and `gid` `1000`. The host possibly uses this ids for different purposes leading to unfavorable effects. From the host it appears as if the mounted data volumes are owned by the host's user/group `1000`.\n\nAlso the container processes seem to be executed as the host's user/group `1000`. The container can be configured to map the `uid` and `gid` of `redmine` user to different ids on host by passing the environment variables `USERMAP_UID` and `USERMAP_GID`. The following command maps the ids to user and group `redmine` on the host.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm [options] \\\n  --env=\"USERMAP_UID=500\" --env=\"USERMAP_GID=500\" \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n### Available Configuration Parameters\n\n*Please refer the docker run command options for the `--env-file` flag where you can specify all required environment variables in a single file. This will save you from writing a potentially long docker run command.*\n\nBelow is the complete list of parameters that can be set using environment variables.\n\n- **REDMINE_HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) port on server.

You can find a list of available plugins in the [Redmine Plugins Directory](http://www.redmine.org/plugins). You can also [search](https://github.com/search?type=Repositories&language=&q=redmine&repo=&langOverride=&x=0&y=0&start_value=1) for plugins on github.\n\n*Please check the plugin compatibility with the redmine version before installing a plugin.*\n\n## Installing Plugins\n\nPlugins should be installed in the `plugins` directory at the [data store](#data-store). If you are following the readme verbatim, on the host this location would be `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins`.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins\n```\n\nTo install a plugin, simply copy the plugin assets to the `plugins` directory. For example, to install the [recurring tasks](https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks) plugin:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins\ngit clone https://github.com/nutso/redmine-plugin-recurring-tasks.git\n```\n\nFor most plugins this is all you need to do. With the plugin installed you can start the docker image normally. The image will detect that a plugin has been added (or removed) and automatically install the required gems and perform the plugin migrations and will be ready for use.\n\n***If the gem installation fails after adding a new plugin, please retry after removing the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/tmp` directory***\n\nIn some cases it might be necessary to install additional packages and/or perform some post installation setup for a plugin to function correctly. For such case the image allows you to install a `pre-install.sh` and `post-install.sh` script at the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins` directory that will be executed everytime the image is started.\n\nFor example, the recurring tasks plugin requires that you create a cron job to periodically execute a rake task. To achieve this, create the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/post-install.sh` file with the following content:\n\n```bash\n## Recurring Tasks Configuration\n\n# get the list existing cron jobs for the redmine user\ncrontab -u redmine -l 2>/dev/null >/tmp/cron.redmine\n\n# add new job for recurring tasks if it does not exist\nif ! grep -q redmine:recur_tasks /tmp/cron.redmine; then\n  echo '@hourly cd /home/redmine/redmine && bundle exec rake redmine:recur_tasks RAILS_ENV=production >> log/cron_rake.log 2>&1' >>/tmp/cron.redmine\n  crontab -u redmine /tmp/cron.redmine 2>/dev/null\nfi\n\n# remove the temporary file\nrm -rf /tmp/cron.redmine\n\n## End of Recurring Tasks Configuration\n```\n\nNow whenever the image is started the `post-install.sh` script will be executed and the required cron job will be installed.\n\nIf you need to install additional packages to satisfy a plugins dependencies then install such packages using the `pre-install.sh` script.\n\nPreviously this image packaged a couple of plugins by default. Existing users would notice that those plugins are no longer available. If you want them back, follow these instructions:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins\nwget http://goo.gl/iJcvCP -O - | sh\n```\n\n*Please Note: this [plugin install script](https://gist.github.com/sameersbn/dd24dfdd13bc5.0.0-11a5) is not maintained and you would need to fix it if required (especially broken links)*\n\n### Reloading plugins for development\n\nChanging files in /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins won't be automatically loaded. If you want\nto reload the plugins without restarting the docker, you can run the following.\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it redmine redmine-install-plugins\n```\n\n## Uninstalling Plugins\n\nTo uninstall plugins you need to first tell redmine about the plugin you need to uninstall. This is done via a rake task:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 \\\n  app:rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=plugin_name VERSION=0\n```\n\nOnce the rake task has been executed, the plugin should be removed from the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/` directory.\n\n```bash\nrm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/plugin_name\n```\n\nAny configuration that you may have added in the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/post-install.sh` script for the plugin should also be removed.\n\nFor example, to remove the recurring tasks plugin:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -it --rm \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine:/home/redmine/data \\\n  --volume=/srv/docker/redmine/redmine-logs:/var/log/redmine/ \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 \\\n  app:rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=recurring_tasks VERSION=0\nrm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/plugins/recurring_tasks\n```\n\nNow when the image is started the plugin will be gone.\n\n# Themes\n\nJust like plugins, redmine allows users to install additional themes. You can find a list of available themes in the [Redmine Themes Directory](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Theme_List)\n\n## Installing Themes\n\nThemes should be installed in the `themes` directory at the [data store](#data-store). If you are following the readme verbatim, on the host this location would be `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes`.\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes\n```\n\nTo install a theme, simply copy the theme assets to the `themes` directory. For example, to install the [gitmike](https://github.com/makotokw/redmine-theme-gitmike) theme:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes\ngit clone https://github.com/makotokw/redmine-theme-gitmike.git gitmike\n```\n\nWith the theme installed you can start the docker image normally and the newly installed theme should be available for use.\n\nPreviously this image packaged a couple of themes by default. Existing users would notice that those themes are no longer available. If you want them back, follow these instructions:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes\nwget http://goo.gl/deKDpp -O - | sh\n```\n\n*Please Note: this [theme install script](https://gist.github.com/sameersbn/aaa1b7bb064703c1e23c) is not maintained and you would need to fix it if required (especially broken links)*\n\n### Reloading themes for development\n\nChanging files in /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes won't be automatically loaded. If you want\nto reload the themes without restarting the docker, you can run the following.\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it redmine redmine-install-themes\n```\n\n## Uninstalling Themes\n\nTo uninstall themes you simply need to remove the theme from the `/srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/` directory and restart the image.\n\n```bash\nrm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/theme_name\n```\n\nFor example, to remove the gitmike theme:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/redmine/themes/gitmike\n```\n\nNow when the image is started the theme will be not be available anymore.\n\n# Maintenance\n\n## Creating backups\n\n**Only available in versions >`3.2.0-2`, >`3.1.3-1`, >`3.0.7-1` and >`2.6.9-1`**\n\nThe image allows users to create backups of the Redmine installation using the `app:backup:create` command or the `redmine-backup-create` helper script. The generated backup consists of configuration files, uploaded files and the sql database.\n\nBefore generating a backup — stop and remove the running instance.\n\n```bash\ndocker stop redmine && docker rm redmine\n```\n\nRelaunch the container with the `app:backup:create` argument.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name redmine -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 app:backup:create\n```\n\nThe backup will be created in the `backups/` folder of the [Data Store](#data-store). You can change the location using the `REDMINE_BACKUPS_DIR` configuration parameter.\n\n> **NOTE**\n>\n> Backups can also be generated on a running instance using:\n>\n>  ```bash\n>  docker exec -it redmine redmine-backup-create\n>  ```\n>\n>  To avoid undesired side-effects, you are advised against creating a backup on a running instance.\n\n## Restoring Backups\n\n**Only available in versions >`3.2.0-2`, >`3.1.3-1`, >`3.0.7-1` and >`2.6.9-1`**\n\nBackups created using instructions from the [Creating backups](#creating-backups) section can be restored using the `app:backup:restore` argument.\n\nBefore restoring a backup — stop and remove the running instance.\n\n```bash\ndocker stop redmine && docker rm redmine\n```\n\nRelaunch the container with the `app:backup:restore` argument. Ensure you launch the container in the interactive mode `-it`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name redmine -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 app:backup:restore\n```\n\nA list of existing backups will be displayed. Select a backup you wish to restore.\n\nTo avoid this interaction you can specify the backup filename using the `BACKUP` argument to `app:backup:restore`, eg.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name redmine -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 app:backup:restore BACKUP=1417624827_redmine_backup.tar\n```\n\n## Automated backups\n\n**Only available in versions >`3.2.0-2`, >`3.1.3-1`, >`3.0.7-1` and >`2.6.9-1`**\n\nThe image can be configured to automatically create backups `daily`, `weekly` or `monthly` using the `REDMINE_BACKUP_SCHEDULE` configuration option.\n\nDaily backups are created everyday at `REDMINE_BACKUP_TIME`, which defaults to `04:00`. Weekly backups are created every Sunday at `REDMINE_BACKUP_TIME`. Monthly backups are created on the 1st of every month at `REDMINE_BACKUP_TIME`.\n\nBy default when automated backups are enabled, backups are held for a period of 7 days before they are deleted. When disabled, the backups are held for an infinite period of time. This behavior can be modified using the `REDMINE_BACKUP_EXPIRY` option.\n\n## Rake Tasks\n\nThe `app:rake` command allows you to run redmine rake tasks. To run a rake task simply specify the task to be executed to the `app:rake` command. For example, if you want to send a test email to the admin user.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 app:rake redmine:email:test[admin]\n```\n\nYou can also use `docker exec` to run rake tasks on running redmine instance. For example,\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it redmine sudo -u redmine -H bundle exec rake redmine:email:test[admin] RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nSimilarly, to remove uploaded files left unattached\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] \\\n  sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1 app:rake redmine:attachments:prune\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it redmine sudo -u redmine -H bundle exec rake redmine:attachments:prune RAILS_ENV=production\n```\n\nFor a complete list of available rake tasks please refer www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineRake.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nTo upgrade to newer redmine releases, simply follow this 4 step upgrade procedure.\n\n- **Step 1**: Update the docker image.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n- **Step 2**: Stop and remove the currently running image\n\n```bash\ndocker stop redmine\ndocker rm redmine\n```\n\n- **Step 3**: Create a backup\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name redmine -it --rm [OPTIONS] \\\n    sameersbn/redmine:x.x.x app:backup:create\n```\n\nReplace `x.x.x` with the version you are upgrading from. For example, if you are upgrading from version `2.6.4`, set `x.x.x` to `2.6.4`\n\n- **Step 4**: Start the image\n\n```bash\ndocker run --name=redmine -d [OPTIONS] sameersbn/redmine:5.0.0-1\n```\n\n## Shell Access\n\nFor debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell using `docker exec` command.\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it redmine bash\n```\n\n# Development\n\n## Upgrading to next redmine release\n\n* Commands to run to update image to next redmine release, examples are from 5.0.0-1 to 5.0.0-1\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/5.0.0-1/5.0.0-1/g' VERSION README.md docker-compose-memcached.yml docker-compose-mysql.yml docker-compose-ssl.yml docker-compose-sqlite3.yml docker-compose-mariadb.yml Dockerfile docker-compose.yml\nvim Changelog.md # Update change log\nsudo rm -rf /srv/docker/redmine/ # Clean old run\ndocker-compose down\ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose up # Test new build\ngit add -p\ngit commit -sS -m \"release: $(cat VERSION)\"\ngit tag -s $(cat VERSION) -m \"$(cat VERSION)\"\ngit push\ngit push origin --tags\n```\n\n* Open https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-redmine/releases and Draft new release\n* Select tag 5.0.0-1 and set release title to 5.0.0-1\n* Publish release\n* Check https://quay.io/repository/sameersbn/redmine?tab=info  and https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/redmine/builds for build progress\n\n# References\n    * http://www.redmine.org/\n    * http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Guide\n    * http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineInstall\n"

Complicated for me, that is... The aim is to make it easy for you, the user. The module changes prop values using the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop), something that is very easy to do with a [Magisk boot script](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/details.md#magisk-booting-process) and some simple commands. This is very useful for a lot of things, among others to help pass the SafetyNet CTS Profile check on custom and uncertified ROMs (see [here](https://didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHide#hn_Matching_official_prop_values_to_pass_SafetyNet) for further details on this). And of course for any normal modification of your device that is done by altering build.prop or similar files.\n\nWhat this module does is that it adds a terminal based UI for those that don't want (or can't) create a boot script for themselves, making the process of creating such a boot script very simple. With this module I'm also maintaining a list of certified build fingerprints for a number of devices, so that it's easy to pick one you want to use.\n\nKeep reading below to find out more details about the different parts of the module.\n\nKeep in mind that this module cannot help you pass CTS if your device uses hardware backed key attestation to detect an unlocked bootloader. There is currently no known way to circumvent that.\n\n\n## Documentation index\n##### Warning\n- [Warning](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#warning-1)\n##### Installation and usage\n- [Prerequisites](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)\n- [Installation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#installation)\n- [Usage](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#usage)\n- [Run options](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#run-options)\n##### What option should I use?\n- [What option should I use?](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#what-option-should-i-use-1)\n  -

Fingerprint, model and whatever prop you want (depending on what options you use). This may have consequences (everything in life does, live with it). Your device might be perceived as a different device (which can create issues with the Play Store, YouTube video resolution, OTA updates, etc) and cause system instabilities and even bootloops.\n\nRead through the documentation to find more details and how to fix your device if things go south.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Magisk v20+.\n\n\n## Installation\nInstall through the Magisk Manager Downloads section. Or, download the zip from the Manager or the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), and install through the Magisk Manager -> Modules, or from a custom recovery.\n\nThe current release is always attached to the OP of the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228). Any previous releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/releases).\n\n\n## Usage\nAfter installing the module and rebooting, run the command `props` in terminal (you can find a terminal emulator on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) or in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps)), and follow the instructions to set your desired options. If you use Termux, you'll have to call su before running the command.\n\nYou can also run the command with options. See below or use -h for details.\n\nIf you want further details as to what this module does and can do, keep reading. To get an overview of what is available, take a look at the index above. If experiencing issues, take a look at the part about [Issues, support,etc](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#issues-support-etc), and don't forget to provide [logs](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#logs) when asking for help.\n\n### Run options\n```\nUsage: props NAME VALUE\n   or: props [options]...\n\nEntering a property NAME and VALUE will save\nthis information to the module settings as custom\nprop values.\n\nOptions:\n  -d    *Update to fingerprints test list during start.\n  -f    *Update fingerprints list during start.\n  -l    *Save module logs and info.\n  -h    *Show this message.\n  -nc   Run without colours.\n  -nw   Run without connecting to the web during start.\n  -r    *Reset all options/settings.\n  -s    *Open script settings menu.\n  -t    Activate test mode.\n  -u    *Perform a module update check during start.\n```\nOptions marked with an asterisk (\\*) cannot be combined with each other.\n\nThe settings option (-s) can be used even if the module boot scripts did not run.\n\n\n## What option should I use?\n### Not passing SafetyNet\nIf you can't pass the CTS profile check of the SafetyNet check there are a few things that you might have to do.\n\nIf you are using a custom ROM (or have a stock ROM on a device that isn't certified by Google) you most likely need to change the device fingerprint to one that has been Google certified. Use the \"[Edit device fingerprint\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#spoofing-devices-fingerprint-to-pass-the-ctsprofile-check) feature.\n\nIf you have a stock device, or a custom ROM and using a certified fingerprint, but still can't pass CTS you most likely need to [force BASIC key attestation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#force-basic-key-attestation).\n\n### Simulating other devices\nSimple: use the [\"Device simulation\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation) feature.\n\n### Working with props\nIf you need to change props edited by MagiskHide, use the [\"MagiskHide props\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#setreset-magiskhide-sensitive-props) feature.\n\nFor adding custom props or removing props from your device, there are the [\"Custom props\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) and [\"Delete props\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#removing-prop-values) features.\n\n## Spoofing device's fingerprint to pass the ctsProfile check\nIf your device can't pass SafetyNet fully, the CTS profile check fails while basic integrity passes, that means MagiskHide is working on your device but Google doesn't recognise your device as being certified (if basic integrity fails there is generally nothing this module can do, please check [I can't pass the basicIntegrity check](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#i-cant-pass-the-basicintegrity-check)).\n\nThis might be because your device simply hasn't been certified or that the ROM you are using on your device isn't recognised by Google (because it's a custom ROM). Stock ROMs usually do not need this feature.\n\nTo fix this, you can use a known working device fingerprint (`ro.build.fingerprint`), one that has been certified by Google, usually from a stock ROM/firmware/factory image, and replace your device's current fingerprint with this. You can also use a fingerprint from another device, but this will change how your device is perceived.\n\n**NOTE:** If you're using a fingerprint for an Android build after March 16th 2018 you might have to change the security patch date to one that matches the fingerprint used. You can use the [Custom prop](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date. If you don't know the security patch date you can try finding it with trial and error (although it's a much better option to find the actual date from the ROM/firmware/factory image in question). The dates are always either the 1st or the 5th of the month, so try different months one after the other until the CTS profile passes.\n\nThere are a bunch of tested certified fingerprints available in the module, just in case you can't get a hold of one for your device. For some devices there are several fingerprints available, for different Android versions. When picking a fingerprint you will also have to pick which version you need.\n\nAfter having applied a device fingerprint from the module, whenever that particular print is updated in the included prints list, the chosen fingerprint will be automatically updated when the fingerprints list is. Just reboot to apply the new fingerprint. If there are several fingerprints available for the same device, this option only applies for fingerprints of the same Android version. In that case, if you want to update to a newer version you will have to update the fingerprint manually.\n\nIf you are using a Treble GSI ROM you can enable the [Use vendor fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#use-vendor-fingerprint-for-treble-gsi-roms) option (for more details, see below) in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu.\n\n\n### Use vendor fingerprint (for Treble GSI ROMs)\nWhen using a Treble GSI ROM with a stock vendor partition, it is sometimes possible to use the vendor fingerprint to make the device pass the CTS profile check. Enabling this option will make the module scripts pull the vendor fingerprint on each boot and use this to spoof the device fingerprint. This in turn means you will only have to enable this option once and even if you update your vendor partition the fingerprint used will always be the latest one.\n\n### Matching the Android security patch date\nFor some devices, if the fingerprint is for an Android build after March 16th 2018, it is necessary to use a security patch date that matches the fingerprint used. For the module provided fingerprints this is done automatically, but if you enter a fingerprint manually you will have to update the security patch date yourself (if they don't already match). If you're setting a fingeprint without using the internal fingerprints list, use the [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date.\n\n\n### Can I use any fingerprint?\nIt's usually possible to use any certfied fingerprint to pass CTS on your device. It doesn't have to match either device or Android version. If you don't use a fingerprint for your device, the device might be percieved as the device that the fingerprint belongs to, in certain situations (Play Store, etc). The Android version generally doesn't matter much, and if you're using a ROM with an Android version much newer than what is officially available for your device, you are going to have to use an older fingerprint if you want to use the one for your device. But, like already stated, that doesn't really matter (most of the time, there might of course be exceptions).\n\nThere are some situations where it might matter what fingerprint you use and Google Play is a prime example. When changing the device fingerprint for your device it is very possible that apps will be filtered in the Play store for that particular device and Android version. If you suddenly find yourself not being able to find certain apps or the latest updates of apps (like YouTube), it might be because you have changed the device fingerprint.\n\n\n### How do I submit a fingerprint?\nIf you have a device fingerprint that you want to submit to the module, just post it in the [Support Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) together with device details and the [matching security patch date](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#matching-the-android-security-patch-date).\nTo make sure that the [device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation) feature works properly with the print you submit, please also include the values for `ro.product.manufacturer` and `ro.product.model` (use the getprop command or the [Android Dumps](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#the-Android-Dumps-method) or [firmware.mobi](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#the-firmwaremobi-method) methods outlined below).\nAlso see [Finding a certified fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#finding-a-certified-fingerprint) below.\n\n\n### Finding a certified fingerprint\nIf you need a certain fingerprint from a device, here are a few tips on how to find it. Also remember that you might need to get the security patch date that corresponds to the fingerprint you find (see [Matching the Android security patch date](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#matching-the-android-security-patch-date) above).\n\nMake sure that you get the actual device fingerprint, since there might be props that look similar to what you need. Here's an example, taken from a Google Nexus 6 (device name Shamu):\n```\ngoogle/shamu/shamu:7.1.1/N8I11B/4171878:user/release-keys\n```\n\n\n#### The getprop method\nYou can get a certified fingerprint for your device by running the getprop command below on a stock ROM/firmware/factory image that fully passes SafetyNet.\n```\ngetprop ro.build.fingerprint\n```\nIf you're already on a custom ROM that can't pass the CTS profile check, this might not be an option... Head over to your device's forum and ask for help. If someone can run the getprop command on their device for you, you're good to go. Or, you can try the other method described below.\n\n*Note that this is sometimes the only surefire way of getting the proper fingerprint.*\n\n\n#### The stock ROM/firmware/factory image method\nAnother way to find a certified fingerprint is to download a stock ROM/firmware/factory image for your device and extract the fingerprint from there.\n\nXDA member @ipdev has spent quite some time creating an automated script for extracting the necessary information from a downloaded stock ROM/firmware/factory image, and it can even create a fingerprints list for you. You can find it together with instructions on how to use it here: https://github.com/ipdev99/mHideGP\n\n*Note that the following is possibly not the best way of finding the fingerprint.*\nThe main problem is that it might be hard to find the actual, certified fingerprint since there might also be other similar props that aren't certified.\n\nYou can find the file to download in your device's forum on XDA Developers (either as a firmware file, a proper stock ROM, or in the development section as a debloated stock ROM), from the manufacturer's website, or elsewhere on the great interweb (just remember to be careful when downloading unknown files, it's dangerous to go alone!).\n\nOnce you have the file downloaded, there are several different ways that the fingerprint can be found. In all cases you'll have to access the file somehow, and in most cases it's just a matter of unpackaging it. After that it depends on how the package is constructed.\n\n- Sometimes there'll be a build.prop file directly in the zip/package. You might find the fingerprint in there.\n- For some devices you'll have to unpack the system.img to get to the build.prop or default.prop file, where you might find the info you want.This can sometimes be done with a simple archive app/program, but sometimes more advanced utilities are needed. On Windows, you can use something like [this tool](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=57742855&postcount=42). You'll also find more info in the [main thread for that post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/how-to-conver-lollipop-dat-files-to-t2978952).\n- Other times you'll find the fingerprint in META-INF\\com\\google\\android\\updater-script. Look for \"Target:\" and you'll likely find the fingerprint there.\n- Etc... Experiment, the fingerprint will be in there somewhere.\n\n\n#### The Android Dumps method\nAndroid Dumps is a great resource for finding props for different devices. [Check it here](https://dumps.tadiphone.dev/dumps).\n\n\n#### The firmware.mobi method\nSometimes you can also find up to date and certified fingerprints at [firmware.mobi](https://desktop.firmware.mobi/).\n\n\n### Custom fingerprints list\nYou can add your own fingerprint to the list by placing a file, named `printslist` (no file extension), in the root of your internal storage with the fingerprints. It needs to be formated as follows: `device name=fingerprint`. The fingerprints added to this list will be found under the `Custom` category in the fingerprints menu. If you create the printslist file in Windows, make sure that you use a text editor that can handle [Unix file endings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline), such as Notepad++ and similar editors (not regular Notepad).\nHere's an example:\n```\nGoogle Nexus 6 (7.1.1):Motorola:Nexus 6=google/shamu/shamu:7.1.1/N8I11B/4171878:user/release-keys\n```\n**NOTE 1:** If you're using a fingerprint for an Android build after March 16th 2018 you might have to change the security patch date to one that matches the fingerprint used. This can be done directly in the fingerprints list, by adding two underscores directly followed by the date at the end of the fingerprint (`__2018-09-05`). You can also use the [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date. If you don't know the security patch date you can try finding it with trial and error (quite tedious). The dates are usually always either the 1st or the 5th of the month, so try different months one after the other until the CTS profile passes.  \n**NOTE 2:** If you want the [device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation) feature of the module to work properly with the prints from the custom list you will also have to include the manufacturer and model in the list. This is done by adding the values for these two props right before the equal sign (=) that separates the device name from the fingerprint. Separate the device name and android versions and the two values with colons (:). See the example above.\n\n\n## Keeping your device \"certified\"\nIf you're using a custom ROM, the chances of it being [perceived as uncertified by Google](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-blocks-gapps-uncertified-devices-custom-rom-whitelist/) are pretty high. If your ROM has a build date after March 16 2018, this might mean that you can't even log into your Google account or use Gapps without [whitelisting your device with Google](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/) first.\n\nMagisk, and this module, can help with that.\n\nBefore setting up your device, install Magisk, this module and use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) described below to pass the ctsProfile check. This should make your device be perceived as certified by Google and you can log into your Google account and use your device without having to whitelist it. Check [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/common/prints.sh) for usable fingerprints (only use the part to the right of the equal sign).\n\nIf you're having issues getting your device certified, take a look in the Magisk troubleshooting guide linked below.\n\nIn case you can't get the Play Store to report your device as \"certified\", see [\"Issues\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#issues-support-etc) below.\n\n\n## Current fingerprints list version\nThe fingerprints list will update without the need to update the entire module. Keep an eye on the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) for info.\n\nJust run the `props` command and the list will be updated automatically. Use the -nw option to run the script without updating the list or disable it completely in the script settings (see [\"Prop script settings\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#prop-script-settings) below). If you've disabled the this setting you can update the list manually in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu or by running the `props` command with the -f run option.\n\nIf you already have a device fingerprint set by the module, and it has been updated in the current fingerprints list, it will be automatically updated when the prints list gets an update. Just reboot to apply. This function can be turned of in the script settings (see [\"Prop script settings\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#prop-script-settings) below)\n\n**_Current fingerprints list version - v137_**\n\n\n## Please add support for device X\nAdding device fingerprints to the list relies heavily on the users. You guys. I've looked up a fingerprint from time to time, but it is a bit time consuming and I don't have that time...\n\nIf you want a specific device fingerprint to be added to the module, see [Finding a certified fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#finding-a-certified-fingerprint) above. If you can find a fingerprint for the device you have in mind, [submit](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-submit-a-fingerprint) it for inclusion in the list of certified fingerprints.\n\n\n## Please update fingerprint X\nFingerprints included in the module are updated once in a while. Mainly if a user (that's you) provides the updated fingerprint, but sometimes I do look up new fingerprints (that is purely based on how much time I have on my hands and how bored I am though, and I have very little time and a very interesting life). Take a look at [Finding a certified fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#finding-a-certified-fingerprint) to get some hints as to how you can find a print to [submit](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-submit-a-fingerprint).\n\nIf you have an updated fingerprint available (and you've [posted it](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-submit-a-fingerprint) for me to update the list), but I haven't yet updated the fingerprints list (which might be a while depending on how much IRL stuff I have to do), it is still perfectly possible for you to use the updated fingerprint.\n\nYou can enter the fingerprint manually in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu in the module, you can use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#configuration-file), or you can make a [custom fingerprints list](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#custom-fingerprints-list).\n\n\n## Force BASIC key attestation\nGoogle now enforces the use of hardware backed key attestation on devices that has the necessary hardware (all devices that shipped with Android 8+ and even some older devices).This can be circumvented by tricking the device into not using the hardware attestation, and it might also be needed to change the prop models (`ro.product.model`) to something other than your devices actual model. This feature can help with that.\n\n@kdrag0n over on XDA Developers have a Magsk module that will trick keystore into thinking that the hardware isn't available and this will then force basic attestation. You can find that module together with details on how it works here:\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-module-universal-safetynet-fix-1-1-0.4217823/\n\nThe Universal SafetyNet fix not only trickes the keystore into using basic attestation, from v2.1.0 it also changes prop values that might be necessary to trick Google Play Services into letting you pass the CTS profile check, so if you're using that module you most likely will not need to use the Force BASIC key attestation feature of this module.\n\nIf you aren't successful in passing CTS by changing the model, you could try using the Xposed (although it is recommended to use LSPosed if you want to have the best chance of passing SafetyNet) module XprivacyLua and restrict Google Play Services. Instructions on how to install LSPosed and XprivacyLua and how to use that module can be found with a simple web search, I won't cover that here.\n\nThis feature of the module has nothing to do with the device fingerprint, but uses the included fingerprints list to find the necessary value to use for the `ro.product.model` prop (and related props).\n\nAs long as Google doesn't roll out hardware based key attestation universally, it seems like we can fool SafetyNet into using the basic attestation by changing the `ro.product.model` prop (to pass the CTS profile check even with an unlocked bootloader). The module scripts will also alter related partition specific props (odm, product, system, vendor and system_ext) to match, if they are available. Thank you to @Displax over at XDA for finding this: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=83028387&postcount=40658\n\nThe prefered method is to pick a device manually from the list of devices (based on the module fingerprints list) or set your own custom value. Do NOT pick your own device, instead try a device that is as close to your actual device as possible. The closer it is to your actual device the less is the likelyhood that things will stop working as a result of the model prop change.\n\nIt is also possible to use a custom value, if that's what you prefer.\n\nIf a device isn't picked from the list or a custom value entered, this feature will by default use an old devices model prop value, based on your device or currently set fingerprint, to make sure that it is recognised as a device without the necessary hardware (picked from the available devices in the module fingerprints list). Using an actual model value from an old device may also help with keeping OEM specific features working (like the Samsung Galaxy Store). If device/OEM specific features still doesn't work after activating this option, or your device is otherwise behaving strangely, try picking a device manually from the included list (see below). If no model prop value from an old enough device is available, the value from `ro.product.device` will be used instead.\n\nNote that using the [Device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation) feature to simulate `ro.product.model` (and related props) will be disabled when this feature is enabled (all other simiulation props will still work though). It is also worth noting that using the [Device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation) feature to change ro.product.model will also force a basic key attestation.\n\n\n## Device simulation\n**_NOTE! This feature is not generally needed to pass SafetyNet's CTS profile test and may even cause issues. Only enable it if you actually need it!_**\n\nIf you want to simulate a specific device (to get access to device specific apps in the Play store, as an example), you can activate this option. It will pull information from the currently used fingerprint (has to be set by the module) and use this to set a few certain props to these values. The props that can be set are (currently):\n- ro.product.brand\n- ro.product.name\n- ro.product.device\n- ro.build.version.release\n- ro.build.id\n- ro.build.version.incremental\n- ro.build.display.id\n- ro.build.version.sdk\n- ro.product.manufacturer\n- ro.product.model (disabled if [Force BASIC key attestation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#force-basic-key-attestation) is enabled)\n\nBy default all props are disabled when this option is activated, but it is possible to activate or deactivate each prop individually or all of them at once. It is also possible to activate several props simultaneously by choosing the corresponding numbers in the menu list and entering them separated by a comma.\nExample: If I would like to activate ro.product.name, ro.product.device and ro.product.manufacturer I would enter __\"2,3,9\"__.\n\nThere are also several partition specific variations of some of the used props (system, vendor, product, odm). If these are available they will also be set to the simulation prop value. This can be disabled in the option settings.\n\nWhenever a fingerprint is set by the module, the `ro.build.description` prop will be set automatically independently from if the general device simulation option is enabled or not. It can of course also be disabled.\n\n\n## Set/reset MagiskHide Sensitive props\nUp to and including Magisk v23 MagiskHide changes some sensitive props to \"safe\" values that won't trigger apps that might be looking for them as a sign of your device being tampered with (root).\n\nThis feature is enabled by default and will automatically change any triggering values it finds to \"safe\" values.\n\nThe props in question are:\n__General__\n- ro.debuggable\n- ro.secure\n- ro.build.type\n\n__Rootbeer, Microsoft, etc__\n- ro.build.tags\n\n__SafetyNet, unlocked bootloader, etc__\n- ro.boot.vbmeta.device_state\n- ro.boot.verifiedbootstate\n- ro.boot.flash.locked\n- ro.boot.veritymode\n- vendor.boot.vbmeta.device_state\n\n__Samsung__\n- ro.boot.warranty_bit\n- ro.warranty_bit\n- ro.vendor.boot.warranty_bit\n- ro.vendor.warranty_bit\n\nThere are a few props that will only change if a triggering value is detected, and these are (by default these will be set in the late_start service boot stage but can be set during post-fs-data if this is changed in the settings):\n__Recovery mode__\n- ro.bootmode\n- ro.boot.mode\n- vendor.boot.mode\n\n__MIUI cross-region flash__\n- ro.boot.hwc\n- ro.boot.hwcountry\n\nAnd lastly there are props that will only change after boot is completed. These are:\n__SafetyNet, unlocked bootloader, etc__\n- vendor.boot.verifiedbootstate\n\nro.build.selinux used to be changed by MagiskHide, but since some root detectors has a broken implementation of detecting this prop it is simply removed instead of changed (MagiskHide did this since Magisk build 20412).\n\nIf, for some reason, you need one or more of these to be kept as their original value (one example would be resetting ro.build.type to userdebug since some ROMs need this to work properly), you can reset to the original value by simply disabling this prop in the module. Keep in mind that this might trigger some apps looking for these prop values as a sign of your device being rooted. If you want to further customise the prop in question you can use the [\"Add/edit custom props\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) feature.\n\nIt is possible to change or reset each prop individually or all of them at once. It is also possible to change several props simultaneously by choosing the corresponding numbers in the menu list and entering them separated by a comma. This will change any props set to a sensitive value to a safe value and vice versa.\nExample: If I would like to change ro.debuggable, ro.secure and ro.build.tags I would enter __\"1,2,4\"__.\n\n## SELinux Permissive\nIf MagiskHide detected that SELinux was in a permissive state it would change permissions for a couple of SELinux related files on the device, to prevent detection of this state. This has been implemented in the late_start service script.\n\n## Change/set custom prop values\nIt's quite easy to change prop values with Magisk. With this module it's even easier. Just enter the prop you want to change and the new value and the module does the rest, nice and systemless. Any changes that you've previously done directly to build.prop, default.prop, etc, you can now do with this module instead. If you have a lot of props that you want to change it'll be a lot easier to use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) (see below).\n\nA custom prop can also be set by running the `props` command with the prop name and value directly in the command prompt (no need for using the ui). See [Run options](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#run-options).\n\nWhen setting a custom prop you can also pick in what boot stage it should be set in. This can also be changed later for each individual custom prop. There are four options:\n- Default - The main module option will decide (see [Prop script settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#boot-stage) below).\n- post-fs-data - The prop will always be set in post-fs-data, regardless of the main module option.\n- late_start service - The prop will always be set in late_start service, regardless of the main module option.\n- Both post-fs-data late_start service - In some special cases you would want the prop to be set during both boot stages. An example would be if the system reapplies the stock prop value late in the boot process (after post-fs-data).\n**Note: post-fs-data runs earlier than late_start service.**\n\nIt is also possible to set a delay for when the prop is supposed to be set. This is useful if a prop value is originally set late during boot, or even a while after the device has finished booting. Pick this option while setting a new prop or editing one that has already been set and enter the amount of seconds you want the delay to be. By default the script will wait for \"Boot completed\" to be broadcast before starting to count the delay. This option can be disabled on a per prop level if necessary.\n**Note 1: A prop with a delay will automatically be set during the late_start service boot stage.  \nNote 2: The delay will usually be sligtly longer than the entered value (mostly counted in tenths of a second), due to small delays in execution of the scripts.**\n\n## Removing prop values\nIf you would like to delete a certain prop value from your system, that can be done with the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop). With this module you can easily set that up by adding whatever prop you want removed to the \"Delete props\" list. Be very careful when using this option, since removing the wrong prop may cause isses with your device. See [\"Device issues because of the module\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#device-issues-because-of-the-module) below if this happens.\n\n\n## Prop script settings\nThere are a couple of persistent options that you can set for the `props` script. These are currently \"Boot stage\", \"Script colours\" and \"Fingerprints list check\". The options are found under \"Script settings\" when running the `props` script. The settings menu can also be opened by using the -s run option (use -h for details).\n\n\n### Boot stage\nIt's possible to move the execution of the boot script from the default system.prop file to either post-fs-data or late_start service. If there are any kind of issues during boot or that props don't set properly, try changing the boot stage to either post-fs-data or late_start service instead. Just keep in mind that this might cause other issues like the fingerprint not setting properly (if set during late_start service) or that post-fs-data will be interupted by having too many props causing the script to run too slow.\n\nIt is also possible to set individual props, like fingerprint, security patch date and custom props individualy. There'll be an option under the corresponding menu\n\nIf boot stage is set to late_start service, general execution or for specific prop types, it is also possible to enable a soft reboot after these props are changed. This can sometimes be needed for a prop to properly be set to memory at such a late stage in the boot process, so if a prop doesn't appear to be set properly during the late_start service boot stage, try enabling this option. This feature is disabled by default since it has the possibility to cause issues on some devices.\n\nNote: post-fs-data runs earlier than system.prop and late_start service runs after, right at the end of the boot process. Having to many props set in post-fs-data may have an adverse effect on the boot process and may result in props not being set properly. Using the default system.prop file or late_start service is prefered if possible.\n\n\n### Script colours\nThis option will disable or enable colours for the `props` script.\n\n\n### Automatic module update check\nThis option will disable or enable the automatic check for a module update when the `props` script starts. If the update check is disabled, it can still be performed manually from within the script, in the main menu, or with the -u run option (use -h for details).\n\n\n### Automatic update of fingerprints list\nThis option will disable or enable the automatic updating of the fingerprints list when the `props` script starts. If the fingerprints list check is disabled, the list can be manually updated from within the script, under the `Edit device fingerprint` menu, or with the -f run option (use -h for details).\n\n\n### Automatic fingerprint update\nWhenever there is an update to the fingerprints list and if you have a fingerprint applied for a device that is on the list, the fingerprint will automatically be updated (if there is an update to that particular fingerprint). This option will not update a fingerprint to one for a different Android version if there are several fingerprints available for the same device.\n\n\n### Backround boot script\nBy default, parts of the module post-fs-data boot script is executed in the background, but the parts that don't might still cause issues on some devices. If there are issues with the boot scripts not running during boot, try enabling this option to execute the script entirely in the background. Keep in mind that this might cause other issues, so only enable if necessary.\n\n\n### Export settings\nIf you have a lot of different props set it can be handy to have a [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) (see below) tucked away for future installs of the module. With this feature you can export the current module settings to a [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) for future use. The file will be saved on your internal storage, in the /mhpc directory.\n\n\n## Configuration file\nYou can use a configuration file to set your desired options, rather than running the `props` command. This is particularly useful if you have a large amount of custom props you want to set. Download the [settings file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/master/common/propsconf_conf), extract it from the module zip (in the /common folder) or copy it from the module directory under /data/adb (in the /common folder), fill in the desired options (follow the instructions in the file), place it in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), in /data or in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and reboot. You can also use the configuration file when first installing the module. Just place the file in the root of your internal storage (or one of the other previously mentioned locations) before flashing the module and the installation script will set everything up.\n\n**NOTE!** If a configuration file is used during boot there will be a reboot during the late_start service boot stage, to load the newly set up values. This can cause issues for devices that have to boot through recovery for Magisk to be active (A-only SAR devices), so a manual reboot after the automatic one will be necessary (or just use the configuration file at install instead).\n\nIf you edit the configuration file in Windows, make sure that you use a text editor that can handle [Unix file endings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline), such as Notepad++ and similar editors (not regular Windows Notepad).\n\nUsing the configuration file can also be done directly at the first install (through Manager or recovery) and even on a brand new clean install of Magisk, before even rebooting your device (also see \"Setting up the module on a clean Magisk/ROM flash\" below). Just place the file in one of the above mentioned locations prior to installing the module.\n\n**NOTE!** Upon detecting the file, the module installation/boot script will load the configured values into the module and then delete the the configuration file, so keep a copy somewhere if you want to use the same settings later.\n\n\n### Setting up the module on a clean Magisk/ROM flash\nAfter having made a clean ROM flash, the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) can be used to set the module up as you want without even having to boot first. First flash the ROM and Magisk. After that you can place the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) (see above) with your desired settings (fingerprint, custom props, etc) in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), in /data or in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and then install the module. This will set the module up just as you want it without having to do anything else. It is also possible to place the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) after having installed the module and rebooting. This will set everything up during boot, but it is possible that this won't work an all device/ROM combinations. If you experience issues, let the ROM boot once before setting everything up.\n\n\n## Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues\nIf you're having issues passing SafetyNet, getting your device certified, or otherwise getting MagiskHide to work, take a look in the [Magisk and MagiskHide Installation and Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk). Lots of good info there (if I may say so myself)...\n\nBut first: have you tried turning it off and on again? Toggling MagiskHide off and on usually works if MagiskHide has stopped working after an update of Magisk or your ROM.\n\n\n## Issues, support, etc\nIf you have questions, suggestions or are experiencing some kind of issue, visit the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) @ XDA.\n\n\n### Known issues\nFor the moment, nothing special (I think). If you've got issues, take a look at the most common problems listed below.\n\n\n### I still can't pass the ctsProfile check\nIf you've picked a certified fingerprint from the provided list, or you're using a fingerprint that you know is certified, or you've forced basic key attestation but still can't pass the ctsProfile check, try one or more of the following:\n- Make sure that [MagiskHide is enabled and working](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHide#hn_Test_MagiskHide).\n- Take a look under [What option should I use](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#what-option-should-i-use-1), to make sure that you are using the proper settings for your situation.\n- If your device uses hardware backed key attestation (any device that shipped with Android 8+, and some older devices too), you will have to [force BASIC key attestation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#force-basic-key-attestation).\n- Do you pass basicIntegrity? If you don't, there's something else going on that this module can't help you with. Take a look under [\"Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) below.\n- Go to the \"Edit fingerprints menu\", select \"Boot stages\", and start by changing the security patch date boot stage to either default or post-fs-data. If that doesn't work, also try changing the fingerprint boot stage to post-fs-data. The default boot stage can also be changed if you go into the script options and change the boot stage to post-fs-data. See [\"Boot stage\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) below.\n- Try a different fingerprint (pick one from the provided list). You might want to reset the \"Boot stage\" settings to the default values first though.\n- If you're not using one of the fingerprints provided in the module, make sure you have a matching security patch date set in [Custom props](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values). See [\"Matching the Android security patch date\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf#matching-the-android-security-patch-date) above.\n- Some ROMs will just not be able to pass the ctsProfile check, if they contain signs of a rooted/modified device that Magisk can't hide, or that they are built in a way that makes it impossible to pass SafetyNet. Check in your ROM thread or with the creator/developer.\n- You might have remnants of previous modifications that trigger SafetyNet on your device. A clean install of your system may be required.\n- If you can't get things working, and want help, make sure to provide logs and details. See [\"Logs\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#logs).\n\n\n### Device issues because of the module\nA common reason for issues with booting the device or with system apps force closing, etc, is having enabled [Device simulation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#device-simulation). This feature is not needed for passing SafetyNet's CTS profile check. Only enable it if you actually need it, and keep in mind that it may cause issues when activated.\n\nIn case of issues, if you've set a prop value that doesn't work on your device causing it not to boot, etc, don't worry. There are options. You can follow the advice in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/Magisk#hn_Module_causing_issues_Magisk_functionality_bootloop_loss_of_root_etc) to remove or disable the module, or you can use the module's built-in options to reset all module settings to the defaults or to disable the module without resetting.\n\nCreate a file (named `reset_mhpc` or `disable_mhpc` depending on your needs, keep reading for details) in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), in /data or in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and reboot. If you want to reset the module, name the file `reset_mhpc`, or if you want to disable the module name it `disable_mhpc`. If you disable the module it can later be enabled again from the Magisk Manager.\n\nIf your device does not have access to /sdcard, /data or /cache through recovery (or there's no custom recovery available), you can disable all modules by booting to Safe Mode (see the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/Magisk#hn_Safe_Mode) for details), or disable Magisk by flashing a stock boot/recovery image. If you use Safe Mode, boot back into regular Android again and all modules will be disabled. Now you can place the reset or disable file in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), and lastly either reenable the module from the Magisk app or reinstall Magisk by flashing a patched boot/recovery image again. At the next boot the module will be reset/disabled and you should be up and running again.\n\nThe reset file can be used in combination with the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) described above to keep device fingerprint or any other settings intact past the reset. Just make sure to remove any custom props that might have been causing issues from the configuration file.\n\n\n### props not found\nThere are two common reasons why you would get an error saying \"not found\" when running the `props` command in a terminal emulator.\n\nYou need to first run `su`. This is especially true if you use Termux, but can also happen on some devices.\nIf you still get \"props not found\" after running `su` it is likely that you have somehow disabled the module. Check in the Magisk Manager and make sure that the module is enabled.\nIf neither of these options apply, check below on how to provide [logs](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#logs) for troubleshooting.\n\n\n### The boot scripts did not run\nSometimes there are issues with the boot scripts and as a result the `props` command won't work. A common cause for this is having EdXposed installed (see above). Always try rebooting to see if things start working, but if they don't, make sure to share the logs (that have been saved automatically to your internal storage) in the module [support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228).\n\nThis issue can in rare cases be caused by the module post-fs-data boot script taking too long to execute. This can be worked around by enabling the [script setting](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#prop-script-settings) to execute the script entirely in the background. This has the potential of causing other issues though, so only enable it if you need it.\n\nIf the issue is caused by having changed any of the script settings (for boot stages, etc), you can still enter the settings menu by using the -s [run option](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#run-options).\n\nIt might still be possible to use the module, even though you can't run the `props` command. Use the [configuration file](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file) to set your desired options and make sure that all the boot options (CONFPRINTBOOT, CONFPATCHBOOT, CONFSIMBOOT and CONFBOOT) are set to use the default boot stage (since the boot scripts don't seem to run properly).\n\n\n### An option is marked as \"disabled\"\nA couple of the options in the `props` script will be automatically disabled in some circumstances. These are:  \n- _\"Edit device fingerprint\"_ will be disabled if another Magisk module that is known to also edit the device fingerprint is installed. This is to avoid confusion about which fingerprint is actually applied.\n- _\"Device simulation\"_ will be disabled if there is no device fingerprint set by the module.\n\n\n### I can't pass the ctsProfile check\nSee [\"I still can't pass the ctsProfile check\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#i-still-cant-pass-the-ctsprofile-check) above.\n\nAlso see [\"Props don't seem to set properly\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#props-dont-seem-to-set-properly) below.\n\n\n### I can't pass the basicIntegrity check\nThis module can usually only really help with the ctsProfile check, by spoofing the device fingerprint. If you can't pass basicIntegrity, there's probably something else going on with your device, but there is a possibility that changing the device fingerprint can make this pass as well. If you can't get things working, see [\"Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) above.\n\n\n### Props don't seem to set properly\nIf it seems like props you're trying to set with the module don't get set properly (ctsProfile still doesn't pass, custom props don't work, etc), go into the script options and change the boot stage at which the props are being set, or change the boot stage for that particular prop, to late_start service. See [\"Boot stage\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) or [\"Custom prop values\"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) above. This might happen because the particular prop you're trying to set get assigned it's value late in the boot process and by setting the boot stage for the prop to the last one available (late_start service) you optimise the chances of the module setting the prop after the system.\n\nIf the boot stage already is set to the late_start service stage you might need to activate the soft reboot option for that particular setting. Sometimes a soft reboot is required after setting a prop for the value to be properly loaded into memory.\n\nThis may also be caused by the post-fs-data.sh script being set to run in the background because of the execution taking to long. Try disabling this option in the [script settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#prop-script-settings) and see if that changes anything.\n\nThere is also a possibility that the prop value you are trying to set is too long. This is only an issue on Magisk releases up until build 22006, where the prop value is limited to 91 characters. Builds after that should not have this issue.\n\n\n### My build.prop doesn't change after using the module\nMagisk doesn't alter the build.prop file when changing or removing a prop value, it simply loads a new value or prevents the prop to load instead of adding or removing it from build.prop. If you want to check if a prop has been changed use the `getprop` command in a terminal emulator to check. Example:\n```\ngetprop ro.build.fingerprint\n```\nIf the prop has been removed, the command should return nothing.\n\n\n### My device's Android security patch date changed\nFor some fingerprints it is necessary to also change the security patch date to match the fingerprint used (the actual patch won't change, just the displayed date). This is automatically done by the module when using a fingerprint from a build after March 16 2018. If you do not want this to happen you can manually add `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the custom props and load back the original date, but keep in mind that this may result in the fingerprint not working and SafetyNet will fail.\n\n\n### My device's model has changed\nIn order to fool SafetyNet into using basic key attestation for the bootloader state check rather than hardware (which we cannot fool), the device model sometimes has to be changed to one that does NOT match the actual device. If your device uses hardware backed attestation, you might have to do this to pass the CTS profile check of SafetyNet. See [Force BASIC key attestation](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHidePropsConf/blob/master/README.md#force-basic-key-attestation) for more details.\n\n\n### The Play Store is broken\nIf you suddenly can't find some apps, or that you aren't offered the latest version of an app, it might be because of having changed the device fingerprint. See [Can I use any fingerprint?](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#can-i-use-any-fingerprint) for details.\n\n\n### The interface looks weird\nIf the interface of the props script looks strange, with a lot of gibberish along the lines of \"\\e[01;32m\", that means that your terminal emulator of choice can't display colours properly (the \"gibberish\" is a colour code). Check the terminal emulators preferences if it is possible to change the terminal type to something that can display colours. You could also run the `props` command with the [-nc option](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#run-options) (No Colour), or disable colours in the [script settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#script-colours).\n\n\n### Boot takes a lot longer after setting props\nIf boot takes longer than usual after setting a new fingerprint or a custom prop, try changing the [boot stage](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) to post-fs-data.\n\n\n### There's a reboot during boot\nThis happens when any prop is set during the late_start service boot stage and the soft reboot option is enabled. A soft reboot can sometime be necessary to properly load the new prop values, but also has the potential for causing issues on some devices.\n\n\n### The screen goes black momentarily at boot\nSee the section directly above about an additional reboot. Same thing.\n\n\n### The Play Store is \"uncertified\"\nIf your device's Play Store reports that the device is \"uncertified\", this is usually fixed by making sure that you pass SafetyNet and then clearing data for the Play Store (and possibly rebooting). More details in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHide#hn_Device_uncertified_in_Play_storeNetflix_and_other_apps_wont_install_or_doesnt_show_up).\n\n\n## Logs\nIn case of issues, please provide the logs by running the `props` script and selecting the \"Collect logs\" option (or running the `props` script with the -l run option, use -h for details, or collecting them manually as described below). All the relevant logs and module files, together with the Magisk log, the stock build.prop file and current prop values will be packaged into a file that'll be stored in the root of the device's internal storage, ready for attaching to a post in the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), together with a detailed description of your problem.\n\nThe logs will also automatically be saved to the root of the device's internal storage if there's an issue with the module scripts.\n\nIf there are issues with other apps or your system as a result of using this module, a logcat/recovery log/etc showing the issue will most likely be necessary. Take a look in my [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHelp) for guidance on that.\n\n\n### Collecting logs manually\nIf you can't run the `props` script for some reason, or the automatic option mentioned above doesn't work, the module logs are stored in /data/adb/mhpc and all files in that directory would be useful for troubleshooting. The Magisk log (retrieved from /cache or saved from the Magisk Manager) and magisk.log.bak would also help. Providing the output from terminal might be useful as well.\n\nPlease provide the above mentioned files in an archive (zip-file), for simplicity and convenience.\n\n\n## Donations\nIf you've had any help from me or this module, any kind of [donation](https://forum.xda-developers.com/donatetome.php?u=4667597) to support the work involved would of course be appreciated.\n\n\n## Source\n[GitHub](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config)\n\n\n## Credits and mentions\n@topjohnwu @ XDA Developers, for Magisk.  \n@Zackptg5, @veez21 and @jenslody @ XDA Developers, for help and inspiration.  \n@Some_Random_Username @ XDA Developers, for all the OnePlus fingerprints.  \n@Displax @ XDA Developers, for all the prints and the basic attestation workaround.  \n@ipdev @ XDA Developers, for being always helpful, bringing tons of fingerprints to the module list and the [mHideGP script](https://github.com/ipdev99/mHideGP).  \nAnd of course, everyone that provides fingerprints for me to add to the list.

Credits to @veez21 for the fix.\n- Stopped using /cache for logs and other module files. New location is /data/adb/mhpc. See the documentation for details.\n- Removed the \"Improved root hiding\" feature. It is most likely just placebo, but more importantly will also mount the system partition as rw on SAR devices. Big no-no... Might make a reworked reapperance in the future.\n- Slight tweaks to the ui and on-screen instructions, for (hopefully) better clarity and understanding.\n- Updated fingerprints for Asus Zenfone 6, Essential PH-1, Google Pixel 1-3a (regular and XL) and Pixel C, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Motorola Moto G5S, OnePlus 5, 5T, 6T and 7 Pro, Samsung Galaxy A5 2017, Xiaomi Mi A2, Pocophone F1, Redmi 5A, Redmi K20 Pro, Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi Note 7.

Several fingerprints have been updated with dual fingerprints.\n- Updated and optimised when props are set during boot. Uses Magisk's system.prop function by default, rather than post-fs-data, to avoid putting a strain on the system during boot. At what boot stage props are set can of course be completely configured by the user (see the documentation for details).\n- Updated the configuration file to match current settings (see the documentation for details). Update your personal files to match.\n- Fixed a bug where the props file wouldn't get the proper permissions when using the configuration file on a clean install.\n- Fixed a bug where saving the simulation value for ro.build.version.incremental would give a wrong vaule.\n- Fixed an infinite loop bug if making an invalid choice when asked to reboot.\n- Optimised and cleaned up some code here and there.\n- Updated the fingerprints list.

In there you can check how to integrate the Adjust SDK into your app.\n\n## <a id=\"basic-integration\"></a>Basic integration\n\nThese are the minimal steps required to integrate the Adjust SDK into your Cordova project.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-get\"></a>Get the SDK\n\nYou can get the latest version of the Adjust SDK from the `npm` [repository][npm-repo] or download the it from our [releases page][releases].\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-add\"></a>Add the SDK to your project\n\nYou can download our SDK directly as the plugin from `npm` repository. In order to do that, just execute this command in your project folder:\n\n```\n> cordova plugin add com.adjust.sdk\nFetching plugin \"com.adjust.sdk\" via npm\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for android\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for ios\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have downloaded our SDK from the releases page, extract the archive to the folder of your choice and execute the following command in your project folder:\n\n```\n> cordova plugin add path_to_folder/cordova_sdk/plugin\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for android\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for ios\n```\n\nIn case you are using Ionic Native, you can add our SDK from `ionic-native` repo:\n\n```\n> npm install @ionic-native/adjust --save\n> ionic cordova plugin add com.adjust.sdk\n```\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-integrate\"></a>Integrate the SDK into your app\n\nThe Adjust SDK automatically registers with the Cordova events `deviceready`, `resume` and `pause`.\n\nIn your `index.js` file after you have received the `deviceready` event, add the following code to initialize the Adjust SDK:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox);\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nReplace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your [dashboard].\n\nDepending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set `environment` with one of these values:\n\n```javascript\nAdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox\nAdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction\n```\n\n**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` when you start developing and testing it again.\n\nWe use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-logging\"></a>Adjust logging\n\nYou can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by calling `setLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following parameters:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelVerbose);   // enable all logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelDebug);     // enable more logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelInfo);      // the default\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelWarn);      // disable info logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelError);     // disable warnings as well\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelAssert);    // disable errors as well\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelSuppress);  // disable all logging\n```\n\n### <a id=\"adjust-project-settings\"></a>Adjust project settings\n\nOnce the Adjust SDK has been added to your app, certain tweeks are being performed so that the Adjust SDK can work properly. Everything that is being done in this process is written in the `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin. Below you can find a description of every additional thing that the Adjust SDK performs after you've added it to your app.\n\n### <a id=\"android-permissions\"></a>Android permissions\n\nThe Adjust SDK adds three permissions to your Android manifest file: `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`. You can find this setting in the `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<config-file target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" parent=\"/manifest\">\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"/>\n</config-file>\n```\n\n`INTERNET` permission is the permission that our SDK might need at any point in time. `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` is the permission which the Adjust SDK needs in case your app is not targetting the Google Play Store and doesn't use Google Play Services. If you are targetting the Google Play Store and you are using Google Play Services, the Adjust SDK doesn't need this permission and, if you don't need it anywhere else in your app, you can remove it. `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` is needed for reading MMC and MNC parameters.\n\n#### <a id=\"gps-adid-permission\"></a>Add permission to gather Google advertising ID\n\nIf you are targeting Android 12 and above (API level 31), you need to add the `com.google.android.gms.AD_ID` permission to read the device's advertising ID. Add the following line to your `plugin.xml` to enable the permission.\n\n```xml\n<config-file target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" parent=\"/manifest\">\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID\"/>\n</config>\n```\n\nFor more information, see [Google's `AdvertisingIdClient.Info` documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info#public-string-getid).\n\n### <a id=\"android-gps\"></a>Google Play Services\n\nSince the August 1, 2014, apps in the Google Play Store must use the [Google Advertising ID][google-ad-id] to uniquely identify each device. To allow the Adjust SDK to use the Google Advertising ID, you must integrate [Google Play Services][google-play-services].\n\nThe Adjust SDK adds Google Play Services by default to your app. This is done with this line in the `plugin.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<framework src=\"com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:+\" />\n```\n\nIf you are using other Cordova plugins, they might also be importing Google Play Services by default into your app. If this is the case, Google Play Services from our SDK and other plugins can conflict and cause build time errors. Google Play Services does not have to be present in your app as part of our SDK exclusively. As long as you have the **analytics part of the Google Play Services library integrated in your app**, our SDK will be able to read all the necessary information. In case you choose to add Google Play Services into your app as part of another Cordova plugin, you can simply remove the above line from the `plugin.xml` file of our SDK.\n\nTo check whether the analytics part of the Google Play Services library has been successfully added to your app so that the Adjust SDK can read it properly, you should start your app by configuring the SDK to run in `sandbox` mode and set the log level to `verbose`. After that, track a session or some events in your app and observe the list of parameters in the verbose logs which are being read once the session or event has been tracked. If you see a parameter called `gps_adid` in there, you have successfully added the analytics part of the Google Play Services library to your app and our SDK is reading the necessary information from it.\n\n### <a id=\"android-proguard\"></a>Proguard settings\n\nIf you are using Proguard, add these lines to your Proguard file:\n\n```\n-keep class com.adjust.sdk.** { *; }\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult {\n    int SUCCESS;\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient {\n    com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info getAdvertisingIdInfo(android.content.Context);\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info {\n    java.lang.String getId();\n    boolean isLimitAdTrackingEnabled();\n}\n-keep public class com.android.installreferrer.** { *; }\n```\n\nIf you are **not publishing your app in the Google Play Store**, use the following `com.adjust.sdk` package rules:\n\n```\n-keep public class com.adjust.sdk.** { *; }\n```\n\n### <a id=\"android-referrer\"></a>Install referrer\n\nIn order to correctly attribute an install of your Android app to its source, Adjust needs information about the **install referrer**. This can be obtained by using the **Google Play Referrer API** or by catching the **Google Play Store intent** with a broadcast receiver.\n\n**Important**: The Google Play Referrer API is newly introduced by Google with the express purpose of providing a more reliable and secure way of obtaining install referrer information and to aid attribution providers in the fight against click injection. It is **strongly advised** that you support this in your application. The Google Play Store intent is a less secure way of obtaining install referrer information. It will continue to exist in parallel with the new Google Play Referrer API temporarily, but it is set to be deprecated in future.\n\n#### <a id=\"android-referrer-gpr-api\"></a>Google Play Referrer API\n\nIn order to support this in your app, the Adjust SDK adds support for it by default to your app. This is done with this line in the `plugin.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<framework src=\"com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:1.0\" />\n```\n\n`installreferrer` library is part of Google Maven repository, so in order to be able to build your app, you need to add Google Maven repository to your app's `build.gradle` file if you haven't added it already:\n\n```gradle\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        maven {\n            url \"https://maven.google.com\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure that you have paid attention to the [Proguard settings](#android-proguard) chapter and that you have added all the rules mentioned in it, especially the one needed for this feature:\n\n```\n-keep public class com.android.installreferrer.** { *; }\n```\n\nThis feature is supported if you are using the **Adjust SDK v4.12.0 or above**.\n\n#### <a id=\"android-referrer-gps-intent\"></a>Google Play Store intent\n\nThe Google Play Store `INSTALL_REFERRER` intent should be captured with a broadcast receiver. The Adjust install referrer broadcast receiver is added to your app by default. For more information, you can check our native [Android SDK README][broadcast-receiver]. You can find this setting in the `plugin.xml` file of the the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<config-file target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" parent=\"/manifest/application\">\n    <receiver\n        android:name=\"com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver\"\n        android:exported=\"true\">\n        <intent-filter>\n            <action android:name=\"com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\" />\n        </intent-filter>\n    </receiver>\n</config-file>\n```\n\nPlease bear in mind that, if you are using your own broadcast receiver which handles the INSTALL_REFERRER intent, you don't need the Adjust broadcast receiver to be added to your manifest file. You can remove it, but inside your own receiver add the call to the Adjust broadcast receiver as described in our [Android guide][broadcast-receiver-custom].\n\n#### <a id=\"android-huawei-referrer-api\"></a>Huawei Referrer API\n\nAs of v4.21.1, the Adjust SDK supports install tracking on Huawei devices with Huawei App Gallery version 10.4 and higher. No additional integration steps are needed to start using the Huawei Referrer API.\n\n### <a id=\"ios-frameworks\"></a>iOS frameworks\n\nAdjust SDK plugin adds three iOS frameworks to your generated Xcode project:\n\n* `iAd.framework` - in case you are running iAd campaigns\n* `AdSupport.framework` - for reading iOS Advertising Id (IDFA)\n* `CoreTelephony.framework` - for reading MCC and MNC information\n* `StoreKit.framework` - for communication with SKAdNetwork framework\n* `AppTrackingTransparency.framework` - to ask for user's consent to be tracked and obtain status of that consent\n* `AdjustSdk.framework` - our native iOS SDK framework\n\nSettings for this can also be found in `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<framework src=\"src/ios/AdjustSdk.framework\" custom=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"AdSupport.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"iAd.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"CoreTelephony.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"StoreKit.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"AdServices.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"AppTrackingTransparency.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n```\n\nIf you are not running any iAd campaigns, you can feel free to remove the `iAd.framework` dependency. If you don't use SKAdNetwork framework, feel free to remove `StoreKit.framework` dependency (unless you need it for something else).\n\n## <a id=\"additional-features\"></a>Additional features\n\nYou can take advantage of the following features once the Adjust SDK is integrated into your project.\n\n### <a id=\"att-framework\"></a>AppTrackingTransparency framework\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nFor each package sent, the Adjust backend receives one of the following four (4) states of consent for access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device:\n\n- Authorized\n- Denied\n- Not Determined\n- Restricted\n\nAfter a device receives an authorization request to approve access to app-related data, which is used for user device tracking, the returned status will either be Authorized or Denied.\n\nBefore a device receives an authorization request for access to app-related data, which is used for tracking the user or device, the returned status will be Not Determined.\n\nIf authorization to use app tracking data is restricted, the returned status will be Restricted.\n\nThe SDK has a built-in mechanism to receive an updated status after a user responds to the pop-up dialog, in case you don't want to customize your displayed dialog pop-up. To conveniently and efficiently communicate the new state of consent to the backend, Adjust SDK offers a wrapper around the app tracking authorization method described in the following chapter, App-tracking authorization wrapper.\n\n### <a id=\"ata-wrapper\"></a>App-tracking authorisation wrapper\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nAdjust SDK offers the possibility to use it for requesting user authorization in accessing their app-related data. Adjust SDK has a wrapper built on top of the [requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency/attrackingmanager/3547037-requesttrackingauthorizationwith?language=objc) method, where you can as well define the callback method to get information about a user's choice. Also, with the use of this wrapper, as soon as a user responds to the pop-up dialog, it's then communicated back using your callback method. The SDK will also inform the backend of the user's choice. Integer value will be delivered via your callback method with the following meaning:\n\n- 0: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined`\n- 1: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted`\n- 2: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied`\n- 3: `ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`\n\nTo use this wrapper, you can call it as such:\n\n```js\nAdjust.requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler(function(status) {\n    switch (status) {\n        case 0:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case\n            break;\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### <a id=\"ata-getter\"></a>Get current authorisation status\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nTo get the current app tracking authorization status you can call `getAppTrackingAuthorizationStatus` method of `Adjust` class that will return one of the following possibilities:\n\n* `0`: The user hasn't been asked yet\n* `1`: The user device is restricted\n* `2`: The user denied access to IDFA\n* `3`: The user authorized access to IDFA\n* `-1`: The status is not available\n\n### <a id=\"skadn-framework\"></a>SKAdNetwork framework\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nIf you have implemented the Adjust iOS SDK v4.23.0 or above and your app is running on iOS 14 and above, the communication with SKAdNetwork will be set on by default, although you can choose to turn it off. When set on, Adjust automatically registers for SKAdNetwork attribution when the SDK is initialized. If events are set up in the Adjust dashboard to receive conversion values, the Adjust backend sends the conversion value data to the SDK. The SDK then sets the conversion value. After Adjust receives the SKAdNetwork callback data, it is then displayed in the dashboard.\n\nIn case you don't want the Adjust SDK to automatically communicate with SKAdNetwork, you can disable that by calling the following method on configuration object:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.deactivateSKAdNetworkHandling();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"skadn-update-conversion-value\"></a>Update SKAdNetwork conversion value\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nYou can use Adjust SDK wrapper method `updateConversionValue` to update SKAdNetwork conversion value for your user:\n\n```js\nAdjust.updateConversionValue(6);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"skadn-cv-updated-callback\"></a>Conversion value updated callback\n\n**Note**: This feature exists only in iOS platform.\n\nYou can register callback to get notified each time when Adjust SDK updates conversion value for the user.\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setConversionValueUpdatedCallbackListener(function(conversionValue) {\n    console.log(\"Conversion value updated callback recveived\");\n    console.log(\"Conversion value: \" + conversionValue);\n  });\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"event-tracking\"></a>Event tracking\n\nYou can use Adjust to track all kinds of events. Let's say you want to track every tap on a button. Simply create a new event token in your [dashboard]. Let's say that event token is `abc123`. You can add the following line in your button’s click handler method to track the click:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"revenue-tracking\"></a>Revenue tracking\n\nIf your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases, then you can track those revenues with events. Let's say a tap is worth €0.01. You could track the revenue event like this:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nWhen you set a currency token, Adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about [currency conversion here][currency-conversion].\n\n\n### <a id=\"revenue-deduplication\"></a>Revenue deduplication\n\nYou can also add an optional transaction ID to avoid tracking duplicate revenues. The last ten transaction IDs are remembered, and revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs are skipped. This is especially useful for In-App Purchase tracking. You can see an example below.\n\nIf you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call the `trackEvent` only if the transaction is finished and an item is purchased. That way you can avoid tracking revenue that is not actually being generated.\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\nadjustEvent.setTransactionId(\"{YourTransactionId}\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n**Note**: Transaction ID is the iOS term, unique identifier for successfully finished Android In-App-Purchases is named **Order ID**.\n\n### <a id=\"callback-parameters\"></a>Callback parameters\n\nYou can also register a callback URL for that event in your [dashboard][dashboard] and we will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. In that case you can also put some key-value pairs in an object and pass it to the `trackEvent` method. We will then append these named parameters to your callback URL.\n\nFor example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` for your event with event token `abc123` and execute the following lines:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nIn that case we would track the event and send a request to:\n\n```\nhttp://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar\n```\n\nIt should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}` for iOS or `{gps_adid}` for Android that can be used as parameter values.  In the resulting callback the `{idfa}` placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device for iOS and the `{gps_adid}` would be replaced with the Google Advertising ID of the current device for Android. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters won't even be read.\n\nYou can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our [callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].\n\n### <a id=\"partner-parameters\"></a>Partner parameters\n\nSimilarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, you can also add parameters that Adjust will transmit to the network partners of your choice. You can activate these networks in your Adjust dashboard.\n\nThis works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance.\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nYou can read more about special partners and networks in our [guide to special partners][special-partners].\n\n### <a id=\"callback-id\"></a>Callback identifier\n\nYou can also add custom string identifier to each event you want to track. This identifier will later be reported in event success and/or event failure callbacks to enable you to keep track on which event was successfully tracked or not. You can set this identifier by calling the `setCallbackId` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nadjustEvent.setCallbackId(\"Your-Custom-Id\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"subscription-tracking\"></a>Subscription tracking\n\n**Note**: This feature is only available in the SDK v4.22.0 and above.\n\nYou can track App Store and Play Store subscriptions and verify their validity with the Adjust SDK. After a subscription has been successfully purchased, make the following call to the Adjust SDK:\n\n**For App Store subscription:**\n\n```js\nvar subscription = new AdjustAppStoreSubscription(price, currency, transactionId, receipt);\nsubscription.setTransactionDate(transactionDate);\nsubscription.setSalesRegion(salesRegion);\n\nAdjust.trackAppStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n**For Play Store subscription:**\n\n```js\nvar subscription = new AdjustPlayStoreSubscription(price, currency, sku, orderId, signature, purchaseToken);\nsubscription.setPurchaseTime(purchaseTime);\n\nAdjust.trackPlayStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\nSubscription tracking parameters for App Store subscription:\n\n- [price](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506094-price?language=objc)\n- currency (you need to pass [currencyCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1642836-currencycode?language=objc) of the [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale?language=objc) object)\n- [transactionId](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411288-transactionidentifier?language=objc)\n- [receipt](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsbundle/1407276-appstorereceipturl)\n- [transactionDate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransaction/1411273-transactiondate?language=objc)\n- salesRegion (you need to pass [countryCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocale/1643060-countrycode?language=objc) of the [priceLocale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproduct/1506145-pricelocale?language=objc) object)\n\nSubscription tracking parameters for Play Store subscription:\n\n- [price](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/SkuDetails#getpriceamountmicros)\n- [currency](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/SkuDetails#getpricecurrencycode)\n- [sku](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getsku)\n- [orderId](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getorderid)\n- [signature](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getsignature)\n- [purchaseToken](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasetoken)\n- [purchaseTime](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasetime)\n\n**Note:** Subscription tracking API offered by Adjust SDK expects all parameters to be passed as `string` values. Parameters described above are the ones which API exects you to pass to subscription object prior to tracking subscription. There are various libraries which are handling in app purchases in Cordova and each one of them should return information described above in some form upon successfully completed subscription purchase. You should locate where these parameters are placed in response you are getting from library you are using for in app purchases, extract those values and pass them to Adjust API as string values.\n\nJust like with event tracking, you can attach callback and partner parameters to the subscription object as well:\n\n**For App Store subscription:**\n\n```js\nvar subscription = new AdjustAppStoreSubscription(price, currency, transactionId, receipt);\nsubscription.setTransactionDate(transactionDate);\nsubscription.setSalesRegion(salesRegion);\n\n// add callback parameters\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\n// add partner parameters\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackAppStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n**For Play Store subscription:**\n\n```js\nvar subscription = new AdjustPlayStoreSubscription(price, currency, sku, orderId, signature, purchaseToken);\nsubscription.setPurchaseTime(purchaseTime);\n\n// add callback parameters\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\n// add partner parameters\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nsubscription.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackPlayStoreSubscription(subscription);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"session-parameters\"></a>Session parameters\n\nSome parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the Adjust SDK. Once you have added any of these parameters, you don't need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally. If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.\n\nThese session parameters can be called before the Adjust SDK is launched to make sure they are sent even on install. If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it's possible to [delay](#delay-start) the first launch of the Adjust SDK to allow this behaviour.\n\n### <a id=\"session-callback-parameters\"></a>Session callback parameters\n\nThe same callback parameters that are registered for [events](#callback-parameters) can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the Adjust SDK.\n\nThe session callback parameters have a similar interface of the event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and its value to an event, it's added through a call to method `addSessionCallbackParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.addSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nThe session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event. The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters. Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.\n\nIt's possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `removeSessionCallbackParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.removeSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nIf you wish to remove all key and values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method `resetSessionCallbackParameters` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.resetSessionCallbackParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"session-partner-parameters\"></a>Session partner parameters\n\nIn the same way that there are [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) that are sent for every event or session of the Adjust SDK, there are also session partner parameters.\n\nThese will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your Adjust [dashboard].\n\nThe session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters. Instead of adding the key and its value to an event, it's added through a call to method `addSessionPartnerParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.addSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nThe session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event. The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters. Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.\n\nIt's possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `removeSessionPartnerParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.removeSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nIf you wish to remove all keys and values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method `resetSessionPartnerParameters` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.resetSessionPartnerParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"delay-start\"></a>Delay start\n\nDelaying the start of the Adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be sent on install.\n\nSet the initial delay time in seconds with the `setDelayStart` field of the `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setDelayStart(5.5);\n```\n\nIn this case this will make the Adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds. After this time is expired or if you call `sendFirstPackages()` of the `Adjust` instance in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the Adjust SDK will resume as usual.\n\n**The maximum delay start time of the Adjust SDK is 10 seconds**.\n\n### <a id=\"attribution-callback\"></a>Attribution callback\n\nYou can register a listener to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this information cannot by provided synchronously. The simplest way is to create a single anonymous listener which is going to be called **each time your user's attribution value changes**:\n\nWith the `AdjustConfig` instance, before starting the SDK, add the anonymous listener:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setAttributionCallbackListener(function(attribution) {\n    // Printing all attribution properties.\n    console.log(\"Attribution changed!\");\n    console.log(attribution.trackerToken);\n    console.log(attribution.trackerName);\n    console.log(attribution.network);\n    console.log(attribution.campaign);\n    console.log(attribution.adgroup);\n    console.log(attribution.creative);\n    console.log(attribution.clickLabel);\n    console.log(attribution.adid);\n    console.log(attribution.costType);\n    console.log(attribution.costAmount);\n    console.log(attribution.costCurrency);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nWithin the listener function you have access to the `attribution` parameters. Here is a quick summary of its properties:\n\n- `trackerToken`    the tracker token of the current attribution.\n- `trackerName`     the tracker name of the current attribution.\n- `network`         the network grouping level of the current attribution.\n- `campaign`        the campaign grouping level of the current attribution.\n- `adgroup`         the ad group grouping level of the current attribution.\n- `creative`        the creative grouping level of the current attribution.\n- `clickLabel`      the click label of the current attribution.\n- `adid`            the Adjust device identifier.\n- `costType`        the cost type.\n- `costAmount`      the cost amount.\n- `costCurrency`    the cost currency.\n\nPlease make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].\n\n**Note**: The cost data - `costType`, `costAmount` & `costCurrency` are only available when configured in `AdjustConfig` by calling `setNeedsCost` method. If not configured or configured, but not being part of the attribution, these fields will have value `null`. This feature is available in SDK v4.26.0 and above.\n\n### <a id=\"session-event-callbacks\">Session and event callbacks\n\nYou can register a callback to be notified of successful and failed tracked events and/or sessions.\n\nFollow the same steps as for attribution callback to implement the following callback function for successfully tracked events:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setEventTrackingSucceededCallbackListener(function(eventSuccess) {\n    // Printing all event success properties.\n    console.log(\"Event tracking succeeded!\");\n    console.log(eventSuccess.message);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.timestamp);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.eventToken);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.callbackId);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.adid);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nThe following callback function for failed tracked events:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setEventTrackingFailedCallbackListener(function(eventFailure) {\n    // Printing all event failure properties.\n    console.log(\"Event tracking failed!\");\n    console.log(eventFailure.message);\n    console.log(eventFailure.timestamp);\n    console.log(eventFailure.eventToken);\n    console.log(eventFailure.callbackId);\n    console.log(eventFailure.adid);\n    console.log(eventFailure.willRetry);\n    console.log(eventFailure.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nFor successfully tracked sessions:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setSessionTrackingSucceededCallbackListener(function(sessionSuccess) {\n    // Printing all session success properties.\n    console.log(\"Session tracking succeeded!\");\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.message);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.timestamp);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.adid);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nAnd for failed tracked sessions:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setSessionTrackingFailedCallbackListener(function(sessionFailure) {\n    // Printing all session failure properties.\n    console.log(\"Session tracking failed!\");\n    console.log(sessionFailure.message);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.timestamp);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.adid);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.willRetry);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nThe callback functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:\n\n- `var message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.\n- `var timestamp` timestamp from the server.\n- `var adid` a unique device identifier provided by Adjust.\n- `var jsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server.\n\nBoth event response data objects contain:\n\n- `var eventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.\n- `var callbackId` the custom defined callback ID set on event object.\n\nAnd both event and session failed objects also contain:\n\n- `var willRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.\n\n### <a id=\"disable-tracking\"></a>Disable tracking\n\nYou can disable the Adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method `setEnabled` of the `Adjust` instance with the enabled parameter as `false`. This setting is **remembered between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.\n\n```js\nAdjust.setEnabled(false);\n```\n\nYou can verify if the Adjust SDK is currently active with the method `isEnabled` of the `Adjust` instance. It is always possible to activate the Adjust SDK by invoking `setEnabled` with the parameter set to `true`.\n\n### <a id=\"offline-mode\"></a>Offline mode\n\nYou can put the Adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers while retaining tracked data to be sent later. When in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in offline mode.\n\nYou can activate offline mode by calling the method `setOfflineMode` of the `Adjust` instance with the parameter `true`.\n\n```js\nAdjust.setOfflineMode(true);\n```\n\nConversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with `false`. When the Adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is send to our servers with the correct time information.\n\nUnlike disabling tracking, **this setting is not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.\n\n### <a id=\"event-buffering\"></a>Event buffering\n\nIf your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance by calling `setEventBufferingEnabled` method:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\nadjustConfig.setEventBufferingEnabled(true);\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"gdpr-forget-me\"></a>GDPR right to be forgotten\n\nIn accordance with article 17 of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you can notify Adjust when a user has exercised their right to be forgotten. Calling the following method will instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to be forgotten to the Adjust backend:\n\n```js\nAdjust.gdprForgetMe();\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will erase the user's data and the Adjust SDK will stop tracking the user. No requests from this device will be sent to Adjust in the future.\n\n## <a id=\"third-party-sharing\"></a>Third-party sharing for specific users\n\nYou can notify Adjust when a user disables, enables, and re-enables data sharing with third-party partners.\n\n### <a id=\"disable-third-party-sharing\"></a>Disable third-party sharing for specific users\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to disable data sharing to the Adjust backend:\n\n```js\nvar adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(false);\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will block the sharing of that specific user's data to partners and the Adjust SDK will continue to work as usual.\n\n### <a id=\"enable-third-party-sharing\">Enable or re-enable third-party sharing for specific users</a>\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to share data or change data sharing, to the Adjust backend:\n\n```js\nvar adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(false);\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user's data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to send the granular options to the Adjust backend:\n\n```js\nvar adjustThirdPartySharing = new AdjustThirdPartySharing(null);\nadjustThirdPartySharing.addGranularOption(\"PartnerA\", \"foo\", \"bar\");\nAdjust.trackThirdPartySharing(adjustThirdPartySharing);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"measurement-consent\"></a>Consent measurement for specific users\n\nYou can notify Adjust when a user exercises their right to change data sharing with partners for marketing purposes, but they allow data sharing for statistical purposes. \n\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user's choice to change data sharing, to the Adjust backend:\n\n```js\nAdjust.trackMeasurementConsent(true);\n```\n\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user's data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-signature\"></a>SDK signature\n\nAn account manager must activate the Adjust SDK signature. Contact Adjust support (support@adjust.com) if you are interested in using this feature.\n\nIf the SDK signature has already been enabled on your account and you have access to App Secrets in your Adjust Dashboard, please use the method below to integrate the SDK signature into your app.\n\nAn App Secret is set by passing all secret parameters (`secretId`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `info4`) to `setAppSecret` method of `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\nadjustConfig.setAppSecret(secretId, info1, info2, info3, info4);\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"background-tracking\"></a>Background tracking\n\nThe default behaviour of the Adjust SDK is to **pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background**. You can change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance by calling `setSendInBackground` method:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\nadjustConfig.setSendInBackground(true);\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, sending in background is **disabled by default**.\n\n### <a id=\"device-ids\"></a>Device IDs\n\nCertain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate Device and Client IDs in order to prevent duplicate reporting.\n\n### <a id=\"di-idfa\">iOS Advertising Identifier\n\nTo obtain the IDFA, call the `getIdfa` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getIdfa(function(idfa) {\n    // Use idfa value.\n});\n```\n\n\n### <a id=\"di-gps-adid\"></a>Google Play Services advertising identifier\n  \nThe Google Play Services Advertising Identifier (Google advertising ID) is a unique identifier for a device. Users can opt out of sharing their Google advertising ID by toggling the \"Opt out of Ads Personalization\" setting on their device. When a user has enabled this setting, the Adjust SDK returns a string of zeros when trying to read the Google advertising ID.\n\n> **Important**: If you are targeting Android 12 and above (API level 31), you need to add the [`com.google.android.gms.AD_ID` permission](#gps-adid-permission) to your app. If you do not add this permission, you will not be able to read the Google advertising ID even if the user has not opted out of sharing their ID.\n\nIf you need to obtain the Google Advertising ID, you can call the `getGoogleAdId` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getGoogleAdId(function(googleAdId) {\n    // Use googleAdId value.\n});\n```\n\nInside the callback method you will have access to the Google Advertising ID as the variable `googleAdId`.\n\n### <a id=\"di-fire-adid\"></a>Amazon advertising identifier\n\nIf you need to obtain the Amazon advertising ID, you can call the `getAmazonAdId` method on `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getAmazonAdId(function(amazonAdId) {\n    // Use amazonAdId value.\n});\n```\n\nInside the callback method you will have access to the Amazon Advertising ID as the variable `amazonAdId`.\n\n### <a id=\"di-adid\"></a>Adjust device identifier\n\nFor every device with your app installed on it, the Adjust backend generates a unique **Adjust device identifier** (**adid**). In order to obtain this identifier, call the `getAdid` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getAdid(function(adid) {\n    // Use adid value.\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: Information about the **adid** is only available after an app installation has been tracked by the Adjust backend. From that moment on, the Adjust SDK has information about the device **adid** and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access the **adid** value before the SDK has been initialised and installation of your app has been successfully tracked.\n  \n### <a id=\"set-external-device-id\"></a>Set external device ID\n\n> **Note** If you want to use external device IDs, please contact your Adjust representative. They will talk you through the best approach for your use case.\n\nAn external device identifier is a custom value that you can assign to a device or user. They can help you to recognize users across sessions and platforms. They can also help you to deduplicate installs by user so that a user isn't counted as multiple new installs.\n\nYou can also use an external device ID as a custom identifier for a device. This can be useful if you use these identifiers elsewhere and want to keep continuity.\n\nCheck out our [external device identifiers article](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/external-device-identifiers) for more information.\n\n> **Note** This setting requires Adjust SDK v4.21.0 or later.\n\nTo set an external device ID, assign the identifier to the `externalDeviceId` property of your config instance. Do this before you initialize the Adjust SDK.\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setExternalDeviceId(\"{Your-External-Device-Id}\");\n```\n\n> **Important**: You need to make sure this ID is **unique to the user or device** depending on your use-case. Using the same ID across different users or devices could lead to duplicated data. Talk to your Adjust representative for more information.\n\nIf you want to use the external device ID in your business analytics, you can pass it as a session callback parameter. See the section on [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) for more information.\n\nYou can import existing external device IDs into Adjust. This ensures that the backend matches future data to your existing device records. If you want to do this, please contact your Adjust representative.\n\n### <a id=\"user-attribution\"></a>User attribution\n\nAs described in the [attribution callback section](#attribution-callback), this callback is triggered, providing you with information about a new attribution whenever it changes. If you want to access information about a user's current attribution whenever you need it, you can make a call to the `getAttribution` method of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getAttribution(function(attribution) {\n    // Use attribution object in same way like in attribution callback.\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: Information about current attribution is only available after an app installation has been tracked by the Adjust backend and the attribution callback has been triggered. From that moment on, the Adjust SDK has information about a user's attribution and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access a user's attribution value before the SDK has been initialised and an attribution callback has been triggered.\n\n### <a id=\"push-token\"></a>Push token\n\nTo send us the push notification token, add the following call to Adjust **whenever you get your token in the app or when it gets updated**:\n\n```js\nAdjust.setPushToken(\"YourPushNotificationsToken\");\n```\n\nPush tokens are used for Audience Builder and client callbacks, and they are required for the upcoming uninstall tracking feature.\n\n### <a id=\"pre-installed-trackers\"></a>Pre-installed trackers\n\nIf you want to use the Adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.\n\n1. Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].\n2. Open your app delegate and add set the default tracker of your `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n    ```js\n    var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n    adjustConfig.setDefaultTracker(\"{TrackerToken}\");\n    Adjust.create(adjustConfig);\n    ```\n\n  Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step 2. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker \n  URL (including `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the six-character token and not the\n  entire URL.\n\n3. Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in the app's log output:\n\n    ```\n    Default tracker: 'abc123'\n    ```\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking\"></a>Deep linking\n\nIf you are using the Adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to get info about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user has your app already installed (standard deep linking scenario) or if they don't have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario).\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-standard\"></a>Standard deep linking scenario\n\nStandard deep linking scenario is a platform specific feature and in order to support it, you need to add some additional settings to your app. If your user already has the app installed and hits the tracker URL with deep link information in it, your application will be opened and the content of the deep link will be sent to your app so that you can parse it and decide what to do next. \n\n**Note for iOS**: With the introduction of iOS 9, Apple has changed the way deep linking is handled in the app. Depending on which scenario you want to use for your app (or if you want to use them both to support a wide range of devices), you need to set up your app to handle one or both of the following scenarios.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-android-ios-old\"></a>Deep linking on Android & iOS 8 and earlier\n\nTo support deep linking handling in your app for Android and iOS 8 and earlier versions, you can use the `Custom URL Scheme` plugin which can be found [here][custom-url-scheme].\n\nAfter you successfully integrate this plugin, in the callback method used with the plugin described in this [section][custom-url-scheme-usage] you will have an access to the content of the URL which opened your app on user's device:\n\n```js\nfunction handleOpenURL(url) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        // Check content of the url object and get information about the URL.\n    }, 300);\n};\n```\n\nBy completing integration of this plugin, you should be able to handle deep linking in **Android and iOS 8 and lower**.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-ios-new\"></a>Deep linking on iOS 9 and later\n\nStarting from **iOS 9**, Apple has introduced suppressed support for old style deep linking with custom URL schemes like described above in favour of `universal links`. If you want to support deep linking in your app for iOS 9 and higher, you need to add support for universal links handling.\n\nFirst thing you need to do is to enable universal links for your app in the Adjust dashboard. Instructions on how to do that can be found in our native iOS SDK [README][enable-ulinks].\n\nAfter you have enabled universal links handling for your app in your dashboard, you need to add support for it in your app as well. You can achieve this by adding this [plugin][plugin-ulinks] to your cordova app. Please, read the README of this plugin, because it precisely describes what should be done in order to properly integrate it.\n\n**Note**: You can disregard any information in the README that states that you need to have a domain and website or you need to upload a file to the root of your domain. Adjust is taking care of this instead of you and you can skip these parts of the README. Also, you don't need to follow the instructions of this plugin for the Android platform, because deep linking in Android is still being handled with `Custom URL scheme` plugin.\n\nTo complete the integration of `Cordova Universal Links Plugin` after successfully enabling universal links for your app in the Adjust dashboard you must:\n\n### Edit your `config.xml` file\n\nYou need to add following entry to your `config.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<widget>\n    <universal-links>\n        <host name=\"[hash].adj.st\" scheme=\"https\" event=\"adjustDeepLinking\" />\n    </universal-links>\n</widget>\n```\n\nYou should replace the `[hash]` value with the value you generated on the Adjust dashboard. You can name the event also how ever you like.\n\n### Check `ul_web_hooks/ios/` content of the plugin\n\nGo to the `Cordova Universal Links Plugin` install directory in your app and check the `ul_web_hooks/ios/` folder content. In there, you should see a generated file with the name `[hash].ulink.adjust.com#apple-app-site-association`. The content of that file should look like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"applinks\": {\n    \"apps\": [],\n    \"details\": [\n      {\n        \"appID\": \"<YOUR_TEAM_ID_FROM_MEMBER_CENTER>.com.adjust.examples\",\n        \"paths\": [\n          \"/ulink/*\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Integrate plugin to your `index.js` file\n\nAfter the `deviceready` event gets fired, you should subscribe to the event you have defined in your `config.xml` file, and define the callback method which gets fired once the event is triggered. Because you don't need this plugin to handle deep linking in Android, you can only need to subscribe to it if your app is running on an iOS device.\n\n```js\n// ...\n\nvar app = {\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.bindEvents();\n    },\n\n    bindEvents: function() {\n        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);\n    },\n\n    onDeviceReady: function() {\n        if (device.platform == \"iOS\") {\n            universalLinks.subscribe('adjustDeepLinking', app.didLaunchAppFromLink);\n        }\n    },\n\n    didLaunchAppFromLink: function(eventData) {\n        // Check content of the eventData.url object and get information about the URL.\n    }\n}\n// ...\n```\n\nBy completing these steps, you have successfully added support for deep linking for iOS 9 and above as well.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-deferred\"></a>Deferred deep linking scenario\n\nWhile deferred deep linking is not supported out of the box on Android and iOS, our Adjust SDK makes it possible.\n \nIn order to get info about the URL content in a deferred deep linking scenario, you should set a callback method on the `AdjustConfig` object which will receive one parameter where the content of the URL will be delivered. You should set this method on the config object by calling the method `setDeeplinkCallbackListener`:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListener(function(deeplink) {\n    console.log(\"Deferred deep link URL content: \" + deeplink);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIn deferred deep linking scenario, there is one additional setting which can be set on the `AdjustConfig` object. Once the Adjust SDK gets the deferred deep link info, we are offering you the possibility to choose whether our SDK should open this URL or not. You can choose to set this option by calling the `setShouldLaunchDeeplink` method on the config object:\n\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setShouldLaunchDeeplink(true);\n// or adjustConfig.setShouldLaunchDeeplink(false);\n\nadjustConfig.setDeeplinkCallbackListener(function(deeplink) {\n    console.log(\"Deferred deep link URL content: \" + deeplink);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, **the Adjust SDK will always try to launch the URL by default**.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-reattribution\"></a>Reattribution via deep links\n\nAdjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns by using deep links. For more information on this, please check our [official docs][reattribution-with-deeplinks].\n\nIf you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to the Adjust SDK in your app.\n\nOnce you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to `appWillOpenUrl` method of the `Adjust` instance. By making this call, the Adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will be sent to the Adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the Adjust tracker URL with deep link content in it, you will see the [attribution callback](#attribution-callback) in your app being triggered with new attribution info for this user.\n\nIn the code examples described above, a call to the `appWillOpenUrl` method should be done like this:\n\n```js\nfunction handleOpenURL(url) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        // Check content of the url object and get information about the URL.\n        Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(url);\n    }, 300);\n};\n```\n\n```js\n// ...\n\nvar app = {\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.bindEvents();\n    },\n\n    bindEvents: function() {\n        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);\n    },\n\n    onDeviceReady: function() {\n        if (device.platform == \"iOS\") {\n            universalLinks.subscribe('adjustDeepLinking', app.didLaunchAppFromLink);\n        }\n    },\n\n    didLaunchAppFromLink: function(eventData) {\n        // Check content of the eventData.url object and get information about the URL.\n        Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(eventData.url);\n    }\n}\n// ...\n```\n\n### <a id=\"data-residency\"></a>Data residency\n\nIn order to enable data residency feature, make sure to call `setUrlStrategy` method of the `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following constants:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.DataResidencyEU); // for EU data residency region\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.DataResidencyTR); // for Turkey data residency region\nadjustConfig.setUrlStrategy(AdjustConfig.DataResidencyUS); // for US data residency region\n```\n\n### <a id=\"oaid-plugin\"></a>OAID plugin\n\nYou can enable **native** Adjust OAID plugin directly from Adjust Cordova SDK. In order to do that, first make sure to read [native OAID plugin docs](https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk/blob/master/doc/english/plugins/oaid.md). Since Adjust Cordova SDK is already adding the native Adjust SDK under the hood, only dependency you need to add to your app from OAID plugin docs is the OAID plugin dependency. After that has been done, you have an option to enable usage of native Adjust OAID plugin by calling `setOaidReadingEnabled` method of `AdjustConfig`:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setOaidReadingEnabled(true);\n```\n\n[dashboard]:    http://adjust.com\n[adjust.com]:   http://adjust.com\n\n[releases]:         https://github.com/adjust/cordova_sdk/releases\n[npm-repo]:         https://www.npmjs.com/package/com.adjust.sdk\n\n[example-cordova]:          ./example-cordova\n[example-ionic-capacitor]:  ./example-ionic-capacitor\n\n[google-ad-id]:         https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html\n[enable-ulinks]:        https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#deeplinking-setup-new\n[plugin-ulinks]:        https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-universal-links-plugin\n[event-tracking]:       https://docs.adjust.com/en/event-tracking\n[callbacks-guide]:      https://docs.adjust.com/en/callbacks\n[attribution-data]:     https://github.com/adjust/sdks/blob/master/doc/attribution-data.md\n[special-partners]:     https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners\n[custom-url-scheme]:    https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme\n[broadcast-receiver]:   https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk#gps-intent\n\n[google-launch-modes]:    http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#lmode\n[currency-conversion]:    https://docs.adjust.com/en/event-tracking/#tracking-purchases-in-different-currencies\n[cordova-purchase-sdk]:   https://github.com/adjust/cordova_purchase_sdk\n[google-play-services]:   http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html\n\n[custom-url-scheme-usage]:      https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme#3-usage\n[broadcast-receiver-custom]:    https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk/blob/master/doc/english/referrer.md\n[reattribution-with-deeplinks]: https://docs.adjust.com/en/deeplinking/#manually-appending-attribution-data-to-a-deep-link\n\n## <a id=\"license\"></a>License\n\nThe Adjust SDK is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2022 Adjust GmbH, http://www.adjust.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A simple \n[`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java) \nis included to get you started with the Trading API - see [Ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) for more ideas.\n\nExchange Adapters for using [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com),\n[itBit](https://www.itbit.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/),\nand [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) are included. \nFeel free to improve these or contribute new adapters to the project; that would be \n[shiny!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series))\n\nA [`TryModeExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/TryModeExchangeAdapter.java) is\nconfigured by default to delegate public API calls to Bitstamp, but it simulates the private\nAPI (order management) calls; it's good for testing your initial setup and \n[paper trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/papertrade.asp) without actually sending orders to the exchange.\n\nThe Trading API provides support for [limit orders](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp)\ntraded at the [spot price](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp).\nIf you're looking for something more sophisticated with a much richer Trading API, take a look at\n[XChange](https://github.com/knowm/XChange).\n \n**Warning:** Trading Bitcoin carries significant financial risk; you could lose money. This software is provided 'as is'\nand released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Architecture\n\n![bxbot-core-architecture.png](./docs/bxbot-core-architecture.png)\n\n- **Trading Engine** - the execution unit. It provides a framework for integrating Exchange Adapters and executing \n                       Trading Strategies.\n- **Exchange Adapters** - the data stream unit. They provide access to a given exchange.\n- **Trading Strategies** - the decision or strategy unit. This is where the trading decisions happen.\n- **Trading API** - Trading Strategies use this API to make trades. Exchange Adapters implement this to provide access\n  to a given exchange.\n- **Strategy API** - Trading Strategies implement this so the Trading Engine can execute them.\n \nTrading Strategies and Exchange Adapters are injected by the Trading Engine on startup. The bot uses a simple \n[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) backed dependency injection framework to achieve this; the long term goal is\nto convert it into a fully configurable [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) app.\n\nThe bot was designed to fail hard and fast if any unexpected errors occur in the Exchange Adapters or Trading Strategies:\nit will log the error, send an email alert (if configured), and then shut down.\n\n## Installation Guide\n  \nThe bot runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nBX-bot requires a Java 11+ JDK (e.g. [openjdk-11-jdk](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) or \n[Oracle JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html))\nto be installed on the machine you are going to use to build and run the bot.\nBe mindful of Oracle's recent [licensing changes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/oracle-jdk-faqs.html)\nand how you intend to use the bot.\n\nYou can use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to build the bot.\nThe instructions below are for Linux/macOS, but equivalent Windows scripts are included.\n\nDownload the latest [Release](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot/releases) and unzip the bot.\n\n#### Maven\n1. If you plan on using your own Trading Strategies/Exchange Adapters packaged in separate jar files, you'll need to add\n   the dependency in the [bxbot-app/pom.xml](./bxbot-app/pom.xml) - see the commented out dependency examples inside it.\n1. From the project root, run `./mvnw clean package` to produce the distribution \n   artifacts `bxbot-app-<version>-dist.tar.gz` and `bxbot-app-<version>-dist.zip` in the `./bxbot-app/target` folder.\n1. Copy either the `bxbot-app-<version>-dist.tar.gz` or the `bxbot-app-<version>-dist.zip` onto the machine you \n   want to run the bot and unzip it someplace.\n1. Configure the bot as required - see the main _[Configuration](#configuration)_ section.\n   The bot's default configuration uses the \n   [`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java), \n   but you'll probably want to [code your own](#how-do-i-write-my-own-trading-strategy)! The \n   [`TryModeExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/TryModeExchangeAdapter.java) is\n   configured out of the box to simulate trading with Bitstamp.\n1. Usage: `./bxbot.sh [start|stop|status]`  \n\n#### Gradle    \n1. If you plan on using your own Trading Strategies/Exchange Adapters packaged in separate jar files, you'll need to add\n   the dependency in the [bxbot-app/build.gradle](bxbot-app/build.gradle) - see the commented out dependency examples \n   inside it.\n1. From the project root, run `./gradlew clean build` to build the bot.   \n1. Then run `./gradlew buildTarGzipDist` or `./gradlew buildZipDist` to build the distribution \n   artifact: either `bxbot-app-<version>.tar.gz` or `bxbot-app-<version>.zip` respectively. \n   It will be placed in the `./build/distributions` folder.\n1. Copy the artifact onto the machine you want to run the bot and unzip it someplace.\n1. Configure the bot as described in step 4 of the previous [Maven](#maven) section.\n1. Usage: `./bxbot.sh [start|stop|status]`\n\n### Docker\nIf you want to just play around with the \n[`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java) \nand evaluate the bot, Docker is the way to go.\n\n1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on the machine you want to run the bot.\n1. Fetch the BX-bot image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gazbert/bxbot/): `docker pull gazbert/bxbot:1.4.0`\n1. Run the Docker container: `docker container run --publish=8080:8080 --name bxbot-1.4.0 -it gazbert/bxbot:1.4.0 bash`\n1. Change into the bot's directory: `cd bxbot*`\n1. Configure the bot as described in step 4 of the previous [Maven](#maven) section.\n1. Usage: `./bxbot.sh [start|stop|status]`\n1. You can detach from the container and leave the bot running using the `CTRL-p` `CTRL-q` key sequence.\n1. To re-attach to the Docker container, run `docker container ls` to get the CONTAINER ID. \n   Then run: `docker container attach <CONTAINER ID>`   \n   \n## Build Guide\nIf you plan on developing the bot, you'll need JDK 11+ installed on your dev box.\n\nYou can use Gradle or Maven to build the bot and pull down the dependencies.\n\nThe instructions below are for Linux/macOS, but equivalent Windows scripts are included.\n\nClone the repo locally (master branch).\n\n### Maven\n1. From the project root, run `./mvnw clean install`.\n   If you want to run the exchange integration tests, use `./mvnw clean install -Pint`. \n   To execute both unit and integration tests, use `./mvnw clean install -Pall`.\n1. Take a look at the Javadoc in the `./target/apidocs` folders of the bxbot-trading-api, bxbot-strategy-api, \n   and bxbot-exchange-api modules after the build completes.\n   \n### Gradle\n1. From the project root, run `./gradlew build`.\n   If you want to run the exchange integration tests, use `./gradlew integrationTests`.\n   To execute both unit and integration tests, use `./gradlew build integrationTests`.\n1. To generate the Javadoc, run `./gradlew javadoc` and look in the `./build/docs/javadoc` folders of the \n   bxbot-trading-api, bxbot-strategy-api, and bxbot-exchange-api modules.\n\n## Issue & Change Management\n\nIssues and new features are managed using the project [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot/issues) -\nsubmit bugs here.\n \nYou are welcome to take on new features or fix bugs! See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved. \n\nFor help and general questions about BX-bot, check out the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BX-bot/Lobby) channel.\n\n## Testing\nThe bot has undergone basic unit testing on a _best-effort_ basis. \n\nThere is a CI build running on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot/actions).\n\nThe latest stable build can always be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot/releases) page. \nThe SNAPSHOT builds on master are active development builds, but the tests should always pass and the bot should always \nbe deployable.\n\n## User Guide\n_\"Change your opinions, keep to your principles; change your leaves, keep intact your roots.\"_ - Victor Hugo\n\n### Configuration\nThe bot provides a simple plugin framework for:\n\n* Exchanges to integrate with.\n* Markets to trade on.\n* Trading Strategies to execute.\n\nIt uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration files. These live in the [`config`](./config) folder.\nAny config changes require a restart of the bot to take effect.\n\nSample configurations for running on different exchanges can be found in the \n[`config/samples`](./config/samples)folder.\n\n##### Engine\nThe [`engine.yaml`](./config/engine.yaml) file is used to configure the Trading Engine.\n\n```yaml\nengine:\n  botId: my-bitstamp-bot_1\n  botName: Bitstamp Bot\n  emergencyStopCurrency: BTC\n  emergencyStopBalance: 1.0\n  tradeCycleInterval: 20\n```\n\nAll fields are mandatory.\n\n* The `botId` value is a unique identifier for the bot. Value must be an alphanumeric string. \n  Underscores and dashes are also permitted.\n\n* The `botName` is a friendly name for the bot. Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed.\n      \n* The `emergencyStopCurrency` value must be set to prevent catastrophic loss on the exchange. \n  This is normally the currency you intend to hold a long position in. It should be set to the currency short code for \n  the wallet, e.g. BTC, LTC, USD. This value can be case sensitive for some exchanges - check the Exchange Adapter\n  documentation.\n\n* The `emergencyStopBalance` value must be set to prevent catastrophic loss on the exchange. \n  The Trading Engine checks this value at the start of every trade cycle: if your `emergencyStopCurrency` wallet\n  balance on the exchange drops below this value, the Trading Engine will log it, send an Email Alert (if configured)\n  and then shut down. If you set this value to 0, the bot will bypass the check - be careful.\n\n* The `tradeCycleInterval` value is the interval in _seconds_ that the Trading Engine will wait/sleep before executing\n  each trade cycle. The minimum value is 1 second. Some exchanges allow you to hit them harder than others. However, \n  while their API documentation might say one thing, the reality is you might get socket timeouts and 5xx responses if \n  you hit it too hard. You'll need to experiment with the trade cycle interval for different exchanges.\n\n##### Exchange Adapters\nYou specify the Exchange Adapter you want BX-bot to use in the \n[`exchange.yaml`](./config/exchange.yaml) file. \n\nBX-bot supports 1 exchange per bot. \nThis keeps things simple and helps minimise risk: problems on one exchange should not impact trading on another.\n\nThe [`TryModeExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/TryModeExchangeAdapter.java) is\nconfigured by default to delegate public API calls to the \n[`BitstampExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/BitstampExchangeAdapter.java). \nIt simulates the private API (order management) calls; it's good for testing your initial setup and \npaper trading, but you'll eventually want to send live orders to the exchange! You'll still need to \nconfigure your API credentials for Bitstamp because the adapter makes an authenticated API call to \nget the buy/sell fees from the [/balance](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/#account-balance) endpoint.\n\n\nThe configuration below shows how to live-trade with Bitstamp:\n\n```yaml\nexchange:\n  name: Bitstamp\n  adapter: com.gazbert.bxbot.exchanges.BitstampExchangeAdapter\n  \n  authenticationConfig:\n    clientId: your-client-id\n    key: your-api-key\n    secret: your-secret-key\n           \n  networkConfig:\n    connectionTimeout: 15\n    nonFatalErrorCodes: [502, 503, 520, 522, 525]            \n    nonFatalErrorMessages:\n      - Connection reset\n      - Connection refused\n      - Remote host closed connection during handshake\n      - Unexpected end of file from server\n      \n  otherConfig:\n    not-needed-on-bitstamp-1: here for illustration purposes only\n    not-needed-on-bitstamp-2: here for illustration purposes again\n```\n\nAll fields are mandatory unless stated otherwise.\n\n* The `name` value is a friendly name for the Exchange. It is used in log statements to display the Exchange's name.\n  Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed.\n\n* For the `adapter` value, you must specify the fully qualified name of the Exchange Adapter class for the Trading\n  Engine to inject on startup. The class must be on the runtime classpath. See the \n  _[How do I write my own Exchange Adapter?](#how-do-i-write-my-own-exchange-adapter)_ section for more details.\n\n* The `authenticationConfig` section is used by the inbuilt Exchange Adapters to configure their exchange trading\n  API credentials - see the sample `exchange.yaml` config files for details.\n\n* The `networkConfig` section is optional. It is used by the inbuilt Exchange Adapters to set their network\n  configuration as detailed below:\n\n    * The `connectionTimeout` field is optional. This is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket\n      connect/socket read when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached,\n      the exchange adapter will give up and throw an\n      [`ExchangeNetworkException`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/ExchangeNetworkException.java).\n      The sample Exchange Adapters are single threaded: if a request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent\n      requests from getting to the exchange. This timeout value prevents an indefinite block. If not set, it defaults \n      to 30 seconds.\n\n    * The `nonFatalErrorCodes` field is optional. It contains a list of HTTP status codes that will trigger the\n      adapter to throw a non-fatal `ExchangeNetworkException`. This allows the bot to recover from temporary network\n      issues. See the sample `exchange.yaml` config files for status codes to use.\n\n    * The `nonFatalErrorMessages` field is optional. It contains a list of `java.io` Exception message content that will\n      trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal `ExchangeNetworkException`. This allows the bot to recover from\n      temporary network issues. See the sample `exchange.yaml` config files for messages to use.\n\n* The `otherConfig` section is optional. It is not needed for Bitstamp, but shown above for illustration purposes.\n  If present, at least 1 item must be set - these are repeating key/value String pairs.\n  This section is used by the inbuilt Exchange Adapters to set any additional config, e.g. buy/sell fees.\n\n##### Markets\nYou specify which markets you want to trade on in the \n[`markets.yaml`](./config/markets.yaml) file.\n\n```yaml\n  markets:            \n    - id: btcusd    \n      name: BTC/USD        \n      baseCurrency: BTC\n      counterCurrency: USD\n      enabled: true\n      tradingStrategyId: scalping-strategy\n  \n    - id: ltcusd\n      name: LTC/BTC\n      baseCurrency: LTC\n      counterCurrency: BTC\n      enabled: false\n      tradingStrategyId: scalping-strategy\n```\n\nAll fields are mandatory unless stated otherwise.\n\n* The `id` value is the market id as defined on the exchange. E.g. the BTC/USD market id is `btcusd` on \n  [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) - see `currency_pair` values.\n\n* The `name` value is a friendly name for the market. The is used in the logs to display the market's name.\n  Value must be an alphanumeric string.\n\n* The `baseCurrency` value is the currency short code for the base currency in the currency pair. When you buy or \n  sell a currency pair, you are performing that action on the base currency. The base currency is the commodity you \n  are buying or selling. E.g. in a BTC/USD market, the first currency (BTC) is the base currency and the second\n  currency (USD) is the counter currency.\n\n* The `counterCurrency` value is the currency short code for the counter currency in the currency pair. This is also\n  known as the _quote_ currency.\n\n* The `enabled` value allows you to toggle trading on the market. Remember, config changes are only applied on startup.\n\n* The `tradingStrategyId` value _must_ match a strategy `id` defined in your `strategies.yaml` config.\n  Currently, BX-bot only supports 1 `strategy` per `market`.\n\n##### Strategies #####\nYou specify the Trading Strategies you wish to use in the \n[`strategies.yaml`](./config/strategies.yaml) file.\n\n```yaml\nstrategies:\n  - id: scalping-strategy\n    name: Basic Scalping Strat\n    description: >\n      A simple scalper that buys at the current BID price, holds until current market price has \n      reached a configurable minimum percentage gain, then sells at current ASK price, thereby\n      taking profit from the spread.       \n    # This strategy is injected using the bot's custom injection framework using its className\n    className: com.gazbert.bxbot.strategies.ExampleScalpingStrategy\n    configItems:\n      counter-currency-buy-order-amount: 20                        \n      minimum-percentage-gain: 2\n            \n  - id: macd-strategy\n    name: MACD Based Strat\n    description: Strat uses MACD data to take long position in USD.    \n    # This strategy is injected using a Spring beanName\n    beanName: yourMacdStrategyBean\n    configItems:\n      counter-currency-buy-order-amount: 20      \n      shortEmaInterval: 12            \n      longEmaInterval: 26            \n```\n\nAll fields are mandatory unless stated otherwise.\n\n* The `id` value is a unique identifier for the strategy. The `markets.yaml` `tradingStrategyId` entries \n  cross-reference this. Value must be an alphanumeric string. Underscores and dashes are also permitted.\n\n* The `name` value is a friendly name for the strategy. The is used in the logs to display the strategy's name.\n  Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed.\n\n* The `description` value is optional.\n\nYou configure the loading of your strategy using either a `className` _or_ a `beanName`; you cannot specify both. \n\n* For the `className` value, you must specify the fully qualified name of your Strategy class for the Trading Engine\n  to load and execute. This will use the bot's custom injection framework. The class must be on the runtime classpath.\n  If you set this value to load your strategy, you cannot set the `beanName` value.\n  \n* For the `beanName` value, you must specify the Spring bean name of you Strategy component class for the Trading Engine\n  to load and execute. You will also need to annotate your strategy class with `@Component(\"yourMacdStrategyBean\")` - \n  see the [`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java).\n  This results in Spring injecting the bean.\n  If you set this value to load your strategy, you cannot set the `className` value.        \n\n* The `configItems` section is optional. It allows you to set key/value pair config items. This config is passed\n  to your Trading Strategy when the bot starts up; see the \n  _[How do I write my own Trading Strategy?](#how-do-i-write-my-own-trading-strategy)_ section.\n\n##### Email Alerts\nYou specify the Email Alerts config in the \n[`email-alerts.yaml`](./config/email-alerts.yaml) file.\n\nThis config is used to send email alerts when the bot is forced to shut down due to an unexpected error occurring in the \nTrading Strategies or Exchange Adapters. The email is sent to the SMTP host using TLS.\n\n```yaml\nemailAlerts:\n  enabled: false\n  smtpConfig:\n    host: smtp.gmail.com\n    tlsPort: 587\n    accountUsername: your.account.username@gmail.com\n    accountPassword: your.account.password\n    fromAddress: from.addr@gmail.com\n    toAddress: to.addr@gmail.com\n```\n\nAll fields are mandatory unless stated otherwise.\n\n* If `enabled` is set to true, the bot will send email alerts to the `toAddress` if it needs to shut down due to a\n  critical error. \n\n* The `smtpConfig` config is optional and only required if `enabled` is set to true. \n  Sample SMTP config for using a Gmail account is shown above - all elements within `smtpConfig` are mandatory. \n\n### How do I write my own Trading Strategy?\n_\"I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one.\"_ - Mark Twain\n\nThe best place to start is with the\n[`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java) -\nmore ideas can be found in the excellent [Ta4j](https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j) project.\nThere is also a Trading Strategy specific channel on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BX-bot/trading-strategies).\n  \nYour strategy must implement the \n[`TradingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategy-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategy/api/TradingStrategy.java)\ninterface. This allows the Trading Engine to:\n\n* Inject your strategy on startup.\n* Pass any configuration (set in the `strategies.yaml`) to your strategy.\n* Invoke your strategy at each trade cycle.\n\nYou load your strategy using either `className` _or_ `beanName` in the `strategies.yaml` file - see the \n_[Strategies Configuration](#strategies)_ section for full details. The choice is yours, but `beanName` is the way to\ngo if you want to use other Spring features in your strategy, e.g. a \n[Repository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html) \nto store your trade data.   \n\nThe Trading Engine will only send 1 thread through your Trading Strategy; you do not have to code for concurrency.\n\n##### Making Trades\nYou use the [`TradingApi`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/TradingApi.java)\nto make trades etc. The API is passed to your Trading Strategy implementation `init` method when the bot starts up. \nSee the Javadoc for full details of the API.\n\n##### Error Handling\nYour Trading Strategy implementation should throw a \n[`StrategyException`](./bxbot-strategy-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategy/api/StrategyException.java)\nwhenever it 'breaks'. BX-bot's error handling policy is designed to fail hard and fast; it will log the error, send an\nEmail Alert (if configured), and shut down.\n\nNote that the inbuilt Exchange Adapters will (some more often than others!) throw an\n[`ExchangeNetworkException`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/ExchangeNetworkException.java)\nif they encounter network issues connecting with the exchange. Your strategy should always catch this exception and\nchoose what to do next, e.g. retry the previous Trading API call, or 'swallow' the exception and wait until the Trading\nEngine invokes the strategy again at the next trade cycle.\n\n##### Configuration\nYou specify the Trading Strategies you wish to use in the `strategies.yaml` file - see the\n_[Strategies Configuration](#strategies)_ section for full details.\n\nThe `configItems` section in the `strategies.yaml` allows you to set key/value pair config items to pass to your\nTrading Strategy implementation. On startup, the Trading Engine will pass the config to your Trading Strategy's \n`init(TradingApi tradingApi, Market market, StrategyConfig config)` method. \n\n##### Dependencies\nYour Trading Strategy implementation has a compile-time dependency on the [Strategy API](./bxbot-strategy-api)\nand the [Trading API](./bxbot-trading-api).\n\nThe inbuilt\n[`ExampleScalpingStrategy`](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies/ExampleScalpingStrategy.java)\nalso has a compile-time dependency on log4j and Google Guava.\n\n##### Packaging & Deployment #####\nTo get going fast, you can code your Trading Strategy and place it in the\n[bxbot-strategies](./bxbot-strategies/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/strategies)\nmodule alongside the example strategy. When you build the project, your Trading Strategy will be included in the\nBX-bot jar. You can also create your own jar for your strats, e.g. `my-strats.jar`, and include it on BX-bot's \nruntime classpath - see the _[Installation Guide](#the-manual-way)_ for how to do this.\n\n### How do I write my own Exchange Adapter?\n_\"Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\"_ -\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nIt's not easy, and can be frustrating at times, but a good place to start is with one of the inbuilt Exchange Adapters - see the latest \n[`BitstampExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/BitstampExchangeAdapter.java)\nfor example. There is also an Exchange Adapter specific channel on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BX-bot/exchange-adapters).\n\nYour adapter must implement the \n[`TradingApi`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/TradingApi.java)\nand the [`ExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchange-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchange/api/ExchangeAdapter.java)\ninterfaces. This allows the:\n            \n* Trading Engine to inject your adapter on startup.\n* Trading Engine to pass any configuration (set in the `exchange.yaml`) to your adapter.\n* Trading Strategies to invoke your adapter's implementation of the `TradingApi` at each trade cycle.\n\n[`AbstractExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/AbstractExchangeAdapter.java)\nis a handy base class that all the inbuilt Exchange Adapters extend - it could be useful.\n\nThe Trading Engine will only send 1 thread through your Exchange Adapter; you do not have to code for concurrency.\n\n##### Error Handling\nYour Exchange Adapter implementation should throw a\n[`TradingApiException`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/TradingApiException.java)\nwhenever it breaks; the Trading Strategies should catch this and decide how they want to proceed.\n\nThe Trading API provides an\n[`ExchangeNetworkException`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/ExchangeNetworkException.java)\nfor adapters to throw when they cannot connect to the exchange to make Trading API calls. This allows for\nTrading Strategies to recover from temporary network failures. The `exchange.yaml` config file has an \noptional `networkConfig` section, which contains `nonFatalErrorCodes` and `nonFatalErrorMessages` elements - \nthese can be used to tell the adapter when to throw the exception.\n\nThe first release of the bot is _single-threaded_ for simplicity. The downside to this is that if an API call to the \nexchange gets blocked on IO, BX-bot will get stuck until your Exchange Adapter frees the block. The Trading API provides\nan `ExchangeNetworkException` for your adapter to throw if it times-out connecting to the exchange. It is your \nresponsibility to free up any blocked connections - see the \n[`AbstractExchangeAdapter`](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges/AbstractExchangeAdapter.java)\nfor an example how to do this.\n\nThe Trading Engine will also call your adapter directly when performing the _Emergency Stop_ check to see if the \n`emergencyStopCurrency` wallet balance on the exchange drops below the configured `emergencyStopBalance` value.\nIf this call to the [`TradingApi`](./bxbot-trading-api/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/trading/api/TradingApi.java)\n`getBalanceInfo()` fails and is not due to a `ExchangeNetworkException`, the Trading Engine will log the error, send an \nEmail Alert (if configured), and shut down. If the API call failed due to an `ExchangeNetworkException`, the \nTrading Engine will log the error and sleep until the next trade cycle.\n\n##### Configuration\nYou provide your Exchange Adapter details in the `exchange.yaml` file - see the \n_[Exchange Adapters Configuration](#exchange-adapters)_ section for full details.\n\nThe `otherConfig` section in the `exchange.yaml` allows you to set key/value pair config items to pass to your\nExchange Adapter implementation. On startup, the Trading Engine will pass the config to your Exchange Adapter's \n`init(ExchangeConfig config)` method. \n\n##### Dependencies\nYour Exchange Adapter implementation has a compile-time dependency on the [Trading API](./bxbot-trading-api).\n\nThe inbuilt Exchange Adapters also have compile-time dependencies on log4j, Google Gson, and Google Guava.\n\n##### Packaging & Deployment\nTo get going fast, you can code your Exchange Adapter and place it in the \n[bxbot-exchanges](./bxbot-exchanges/src/main/java/com/gazbert/bxbot/exchanges) module alongside the other inbuilt\nadapters. When you build the project, your Exchange Adapter will be included in the BX-bot jar. You can also create \nyour own jar for your adapters, e.g. `my-adapters.jar`, and include it on BX-bot's runtime classpath -\nsee the _[Installation Guide](#the-manual-way)_ for how to do this.\n\n### Logging\nLogging for the bot is provided by [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j). The log file is written to `logs/bxbot.log` \nusing a rolling policy. When a log file size reaches 100 MB or a new day is started, it is archived and a new log file \nis created. BX-bot will create up to 7 archives on the same day; these are stored in a directory based on the current \nyear and month. Only the last 90 archives are kept. Each archive is compressed using gzip. The logging level is set \nat `info`. You can change this default logging configuration in the [`config/log4j2.xml`](./config/log4j2.xml) file.\n\nWe recommend running at `info` level, as `debug` level logging will produce a *lot* of\noutput from the Exchange Adapters; it's very handy for debugging, but not so good for your disk space!\n \n### REST API\n_\"Enlightenment means taking full responsibility for your life.\"_ - William Blake\n\nThe bot has a REST API that allows you to remotely:\n\n* View and update Engine, Exchange, Markets, Strategy, and Email Alerts config.\n* View and download the log file.\n* Restart the bot - this is necessary for any config changes to take effect.\n\nIt has role based access control \n([RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)): Users can view config and the\nlogs, but only administrators can update config and restart the bot.\n\nIt is secured using [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and has [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\nsupport for Production environments. \n\nYou can view the [Springdocs](https://springdoc.org/) at: \n[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) once you've configured\nand started the bot.\n\n#### Configuration\nThe REST API listens for plain HTTP traffic on port `8080` by default - you can change the \n`server.port` in the [./config/application.properties](./config/application.properties) file.\n \n**Warning:** The bot must be configured to use TLS if you plan on accessing the REST API over a\npublic network - see the _[TLS](#tls)_ section below.\n\nYou _must_ also change the `bxbot.restapi.jwt.secret` value in the \n[./config/application.properties](./config/application.properties) before using the REST API over a public network.\nThis is the key that is used to sign your web tokens - the JWTs are signed using the HS512 algorithm.\n  \nOther interesting configuration in the [./config/application.properties](./config/application.properties) includes:\n\n* `bxbot.restapi.maxLogfileLines` - the maximum number of lines to be returned in a view log file request. \n(For a head request, the end of the file is truncated; for a tail request the start of the file is truncated).\n\n* `bxbot.restapi.maxLogfileDownloadSize` - the maximum size of the logfile to download. \nIf the size of the logfile exceeds this limit, the end of the file will be truncated.\n\n* `bxbot.restapi.jwt.expiration` - the expires time of the JWT. Set to 10 mins. Be sure you know the\nrisks if you decide to extend the expiry time.\n\n#### Users\nYou _must_ change the `PASSWORD` values in the \n[./bxbot-rest-api/src/main/resources/import.sql](./bxbot-rest-api/src/main/resources/import.sql)\nbefore using the REST API over a public network - see instructions in the file on how to \n[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) your passwords.\n\n2 users have been set up out of the box: `user` and `admin`. These users have `user` and `admin`\nroles respectively. Passwords are the same as the usernames - remember to change these :-)\n\nWhen the bot starts up, Spring Boot will load the `import.sql` file and store the users and their \naccess rights in its [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory database.\n\n#### Authentication\nThe REST API endpoints require a valid JWT to be passed in the `Authorization` header of any requests.\n\nTo obtain a JWT, your REST client needs to call the `/api/token` endpoint with a valid username/password \ncontained in the `import.sql` file. See the \n[Authentication](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/Authentication/getTokenUsingPOST) \nSpringdocs for how to do this.\n\nThe returned JWT expires after 10 mins. Your client should call the `/api/refresh` endpoint with the\nJWT before it expires in order to get a new one. Alternatively, you can re-authenticate using the\n`/api/token` endpoint.\n\n#### TLS\nThe REST API _must_ be configured to use TLS before accessing it over a public network.\n\nYou will need to \n[create a keystore](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/keytool.html) - the command to\ncreate a [PKCS12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) self-signed certificate is shown below:\n\n``` bash\nkeytool -genkeypair -alias rest-api-keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650\n```\n \nThe keystore must be on the app's classpath - you can put it in\nthe [./bxbot-rest-api/src/main/resources](./bxbot-rest-api/src/main/resources) and re-build the app to get up and running fast.\nFor a Production system, you'll want to replace the self-signed certificate with a \nCA signed certificate.\n\nThe 'TLS Configuration' section in the [./config/application.properties](./config/application.properties) \nfile needs the following properties set:\n\n``` properties\n# Spring Boot profile for REST API.\n# Must use https profile in Production environment.\nspring.profiles.active=https\n\n# SSL (TLS) configuration to secure the REST API.\n# Must be enabled in Production environment.\nserver.port=8443\nsecurity.require-ssl=true\nserver.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12\nserver.ssl.key-store-password=secret\nserver.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12\n```\n\n## Coming Soon... (Definitely Maybe)\n\nA UI built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) - it will consume the REST API. \n\nSee the [Project Board](https://github.com/gazbert/bxbot/projects/2) for timescales and progress.\n"

You can contribute and try your idea on this project. No\npension, but a lot of fun. To contribute, you should:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Create Feat_xxx branch.\n3. Commit your code.\n4. Create Pull Request.\n\n**Note:** DO NOT submit large binaries, or the `Pull Request` may be rejected. If required, you can add the files or\ndirectories to be ignored to the `.gitignore` file.\n\n</details>\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Expand to view details</summary>\n\n1. Failed when upload models.\n\nYou need to compress the model assets into a `zip` file, and the entry file cannot be nested in a folder. The server\nwill decompress and put it in the `./build/public/Upload/Model` folder, and add a record in the MongoDB `_Mesh`\ncollection.\n\n2. How to combine multiple models together?\n\nBasic geometry supports multiple levels of nesting. You can add a `group` (in the geometry menu), and then drag multiple\nmodels onto the `group` in the `Hierachy` Panel.\n\n3. How to enable authority?\n\nEdit `config.toml` and set `authority.enabled` to `true`. The default administrator username is `admin` and the password\nis `123456`.\n\n4. The brower\n   report `asm.js has been disabled because the script debugger is connected. Please disconnect the debugger to enable asm.js.`\n   Error.\n\n**Complete error**: asm.js has been disabled because the script debugger is connected. Please disconnect the debugger to\nenable asm.js. ammo.js (1,1) SCRIPT1028: SCRIPT1028: Expected identifier, string or number ShadowEditor.js (3948,8)\nSCRIPT5009: 'Shadow' is not defined.\n\n**Solution**: Tencent browser does not support `ammo.js` (WebAssembly) compiled with `Emscripten`, it is recommended to\nuse `Chrome` or `Firebox` instead.\n\n5. How can I upgrade from C# to golang version?\n\nThe data structure and web client is not changed, just copy `./ShadowEditor.Web/Upload/` folder to\n`build/public/Upload/`.\n\n6. The desktop version cannot be opened.\n\nWindows requires `Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015`. You can install\nfrom: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145  \nIf the desktop version cannot be opened, you can view `logs.txt`; if the port conflicts, you can modify the MongoDB and\nwebsite ports in `resources/app/config.toml`.\n\n7. How can I create a https certificate?\n\nInstall `openssl`, and git client already contains one; Open `cmd`, `Powershell` or `shell`, and run the following\ncommands:\n\n```sh\nopenssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024\nopenssl req -new -key privatekey.pem -out certrequest.csr\nopenssl x509 -req -in certrequest.csr -signkey privatekey.pem -out certificate.pem\n```\n\nAmong the generated files, `certificate.pem` is the certificate, and `privatekey.pem` is the key.\n\n</details>\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n## Open Source Projects\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Expand to view details</summary>\n\nThanks to the following open source projects.\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go  \nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/toml  \nhttps://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go  \nhttps://github.com/dimfeld/httptreemux  \nhttps://github.com/inconshreveable/mousetrap  \nhttps://github.com/json-iterator/go  \nhttps://github.com/mozillazg/go-pinyin  \nhttps://github.com/otiai10/copy  \nhttps://github.com/sirupsen/logrus  \nhttps://github.com/spf13/cobra  \nhttps://github.com/spf13/viper  \nhttps://github.com/urfave/negroni  \nhttps://go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react  \nhttps://github.com/mrdoob/three.js  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup  \nhttps://github.com/babel/babel  \nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-json  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-node-resolve  \nhttps://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss  \nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-replace  \nhttps://github.com/mjeanroy/rollup-plugin-strip-banner  \nhttps://github.com/andyearnshaw/rollup-plugin-bundle-worker\n\nhttps://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js  \nhttps://github.com/JedWatson/classnames  \nhttps://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch  \nhttps://github.com/i18next/i18next  \nhttps://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie  \nhttps://github.com/facebook/prop-types  \nhttps://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror  \nhttps://github.com/jquery/esprima  \nhttps://github.com/tschw/glslprep.js  \nhttps://github.com/zaach/jsonlint  \nhttps://github.com/acornjs/acorn  \nhttps://github.com/kripken/ammo.js  \nhttps://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui  \nhttps://github.com/toji/gl-matrix  \nhttps://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine  \nhttps://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js  \nhttps://github.com/mrdoob/texgen.js  \nhttps://github.com/yomotsu/VolumetricFire  \nhttps://github.com/jonbretman/amd-to-as6  \nhttps://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG\n</details>\n"

    "text" : "CS 4260 (formerly CS4501) - Internet Scale Applications\n===========================\n\nThis course will provide a survey of methods for building large-scale internet websites and mobile apps. The intent is to build upon prior classes by explaining how theory meets practice. Topics covered will include scaling, security, large team software engineering, etc. There will be a series of cumulative course projects resulting in students building a working marketplace website. Weekly readings from industry and academic sources will complement the weekly lecture.\n\nPrerequisites\n--------------\n\nCS3240 (Advanced Software Development) or equivalent experience building non-trivial Python/Django web applications is required. Understanding issues around persistence, databases, concurrency, networking etc along with Linux experience will be extremely helpful in this class.\n\nA course project will be developed using Python, Django, MySQL, and Docker containers. A basic familiarity with HTML and CSS is preferred but not strictly required.\n\nProject Overview\n-----------------\n\nYou will work in a team of three students to build a working marketplace website. Marketplaces such as Airbnb, Uber, DonorsChoose, eBay, Etsy and Watsi are both highly profitable when they succeed and technically challenging to build. It's up to you to decide what kind of marketplace your team will build. Specific instructions for each project will be posted and linked below thoughtout the semester.\n\nDue dates are listed below for each part of the project. These may be revised as the term goes on based on how everyone is doing. You will be graded as a team (unless unusual conditions warrant giving different grades). Grades will be based on: completeness of solution, correctness of solution, and being on time completing each assignment.\n\nCourse materials\n-----------------\n\nSyllabus and project assignments will be here in GitHub. Feel free to fork and send PRs with corrections, additions or any other changes you think would help fellow/future students.\n\nLecture slides are in Google drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzWAJQVnIIRYfk9JUmwtbUVKS1pqb0k0Q2ZYU3pPZ3gxV2VnVDctVU51VjFYTTVaR25xR3c&usp=sharing. Note that prior semester's slides can be found here for future lectures, but they may be out of date / subject to update this semester. Generally, the further out a lecture is the more likely that the slides have not been reworked for this semester.\n\nReadings are listed for each week and should be completed BEFORE the week they are assigned so that we can discuss in class. There's also this useful high-level summary of many of the topics in this course https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer\n\nCourse Topics (subject to revision as course progresses)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.

You must ask for it via email at least 72 hours (3 days) before the project is due. You must email your primary TA and Tom to ask for it. \n\nAcademic Honor Code\n-------------------\n\nAll work products that you submit for this class—whether projects, quizes or anything else—is assumed to be your own\ncreation UNLESS you specifically call out that you are including someone else's work, either in spirit or verbatim. Violating\nthis honor code will result in severe disciplinary action potentially including referral to the University Honor Code comittee\nwho may recommend expulsion.\n\nIf there is reason for you to submit other's work in your github repo then you must cite them as the author of\nthe work. If their work has a copyright notice on it, make sure that copyright notice is perserved and contained in your work\nsaying \"Portions of this work copyright DATE by AUTHOR\". If the work has a license agreement associated with it, make sure you\nare complying with the terms of the license agreement. If there is no license or copyright, you must still explicitly list the\nauthor(s) whose work you are including. This should be in the form of a comment at the top of the source file including their\nwork.\n\nFinally, if you are using someone else's work as the substantial basis of your work (even if you're not literally copying it\ncharacter by character) then you are still copying their work and you must cite them.\n\nOffice Hours\n-------------\n\nThe teaching staff for this semester are:\n\n- Tom Pinckney (Lecturer) tp3ks@virginia.edu\n- Handley, Tyler M (tmh6de) and Head TA <tmh6de@virginia.edu>\n- Yennu, Ankith Gopikrishna (agy8gc) <agy8gc@virginia.edu>\n- Lasker, Rashid E (rel3en) <rel3en@virginia.edu>\n- Hector, Selwyn N (snh3fa) <snh3fa@virginia.edu>\n- Wong, William (ww5zf) <ww5zf@virginia.edu>\n\nOffice Hours for Project Review, Help, and Demo Hours (led by TAs):\n\n- Handley, Tyler M (tmh6de) Mon: 11:30-12:30 in Rice 442\n- Yennu, Ankith (agy8gc): Wed: 1:00pm-3:00pm in TBD\n- Lasker, Rashid (rel3en): Mon, Wed: 3:00pm-4:50pm in Thornton Stacks\n- Hector, Selwyn (snh3fa): Tue, Thurs: 9:30am-11am in Rice 442\n\n|      | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday       | Thursday | Friday |\n| ---- | ------ | ------- | --------------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 9:30  |        | Selwyn, Rice 442|        | Selwyn, Rice 442   |        |\n| 10:30 |        |          |    |    |         |\n| 11:30 | Tyler, Rice 442|||||\n| 12:00 |        |   |                 |          | |\n| 1:00 |        |         |       Ankith, TBD          |          |        |\n| 2:00 |        ||  |   |        |\n| 3:00 | Rashid, Stacks |  | Rashid,Stacks |          |        |\n| 4:30 |        |         |                 |          |        |\n\nThere is also always help from the teaching staff and your fellow classmates through slack at https://cs4501-isa.slack.com.\n\nWe will use Collab announcements when I need to email everyone in the class for announcements, project assignments etc. I'll send a Welcome announcement after the first class. If you don't receive it, check with me or the TA's to figure out what's wrong. If you added the class after the first day then please make sure to review the archive of announcements on Collab.\n\nFinally, it's always better to ask questions, bring up problems, etc. sooner versus later. Please don't be shy. I enjoy people coming to office hours, asking question on Slack, bringing things up in class etc.\n"

职责不同：frida注重打造调试引擎、objection注重将frida的api简单封装一下让你好快速上手frida。而hooker是重新站在一个安卓应用开发和安卓逆向工程师的角度去打造的更加专业Android逆向工作台，重新定义了逆向android的工作方式。\n- 封装不同：frida是基于gumjs（V8）、C/C++封装的调试引擎，用于动态Hook跟踪、拦截和主动调用函数等。hooker是基于frida作为引擎和自己打造的Dex库（radar）调用Android Framework层代码完成的。\n- 交互方式不一样：frida和objection只有attach上才能操作各种指令，而hooker提供shell命令行交互式让你可以通过jadx进行动静结合分析。\n- 更注提供重Android逆向思路和线索：frida和objection没有对任何Android Freamwork层的hook和能主动调用代码点位进行封装，这使得难以有逆向思路。而hooker的几乎所有命令都是围绕Android Freamwork进行封装，让一个即使没有Android开发经验的人也能快速找到逆向分析思路。\n- hook脚本产出方式不一样：frida你需要先进行很多语法方面的学习，才能完成对各种类的各种方法进行frida脚本的编写。hooker不需要你了解frida语法细节，比如你只需通过j okhttp3.OkHttpClient:newCall 就可以生成一个hook okhttp3.OkHttpClient类的newCall方法的脚本, 即使对于任何一个被混淆的类操作也是如此。（你应该把更多的时间和精力放在逆向思路上，而不是熟悉某些语法上。）\n- 提供操作原生AndroidUI功能：你可以./attach每个app目录下的android_ui.js脚本，它提供了通过ViewId、ViewText找到Android原生的View并点击，或者你想强制打开某个Activity（比如某个界面只有会员才能进入，这时候你就可以采用Android\"原生代码\"打开的方式）。\n\n# 环境部署\n前言：hooker仅支持在Linux和MacOS下运行，并且现在和将来都不会支持windows操作系统！windows做开发是没有灵魂的！\n\n### 1. git clone项目\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker.git\nstephen@ubuntu:~$ cd

3. 手机连接adb\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ adb devices\nList of devices attached\nFA77C0301476\tdevice\n```\n\n\n### 4. 手机开发环境部署\n如果你的手机已经启动了frida-server，可以忽略这步。\n\n注意:部分手机出现部署之后adb连不上的问题，那请使用deploy2.sh。\n\n```shell\n#以piexl2为例\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ adb push mobile-deploy/ /sdcard/\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ adb shell #进入手机命令行界面\nsailfish:/ $ su #进入root权限命令行模式\nsailfish:/ $ sh /sdcard/mobile-deploy/deploy.sh                                                            \ndisable android firewall.\nstart frida-server\nstart network adb.\ndeploy successfull.\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ #如果你看到你的adb命令被弹出来了，表示已经正常部署。\n```\n![部署演示](assets/hooker-deploy.gif)\n***\n\n### 5. 指定fridaserver端口的手机开发环境部署\n\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ adb shell #进入手机命令行界面\nsailfish:/ $ su #进入root权限命令行模式\nsailfish:/ $ sh /sdcard/mobile-deploy/deploy.sh 6666  #deploy.sh启动失败的同样可以尝试deploy2.sh                                                   \ndisable android firewall.\nset firda_server_bind_port to 6666\nstart frida-server\nstart network adb.\ndeploy successfull.\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ #如果你看到你的adb命令被弹出来了，表示已经正常部署。\n```\n***\n\n注意：自定义frida server端口的开发环境必须走host:post的方式调试，因为usb默认找27042端口。所以请务必[更改本地.hooker_driver文件](#远程frida支持)，否则hooker无法正常工作。\n\n### 6. 部署之后手机的增强功能\n- 1.关闭iptables防火墙，解决部分手机默认防火墙开启的问题\n- 2.启动frida-server，如果你的手机是arm64他将优先启动arm64位的frida-server\n- 3.在/data/mobile-deploy目录生成tools_env.rc 当你有内网穿透和网络服务转发、编辑文件、检测网络方面的需求时可以执行source /data/mobile-deploy/tools_env.rc，它将临时生成vi、telnet、frpc、tcpforward、ll命令以便你进行更便捷的开发，如图\n![部署演示](assets/tools_env.gif)\n***\n- 4.启动网络adb，即你可以直接通过远程adb调试手机。例如:adb connect 192.168.0.105\n![部署演示](assets/remote_adb.gif)\n***\n\n\n# 快速开始\n\n### 1. 查看可调试进程\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ ./hooker \n  PID  Name                           Identifier

应用工作目录\n应用工作目录的意义在于提供一个的地方存放和管理frida脚本和快捷命令。hooker在你第一次调试应用时会创建应用工作目录，并初始化一些通杀脚本和快捷命令。\n\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker/com.ss.android.ugc.aweme$ ls -l\ntotal 784\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 stephen stephen

attach的基础上增加了将hook输出信息持久化到log文件中，比如当你hook一个调用非常频繁的函数比如某些字符串生成，输出的日志量无法短时间去全面，这时候你可以用文本编辑器打开log文件慢慢分析。以抖音工作目录为例，hooking实现如下\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nHOOKER_DRIVER=$(cat ../.hooker_driver)\necho \"hooking $1\" > log\ndate | tee -ai log\nfrida $HOOKER_DRIVER -l $1 com.ss.android.ugc.aweme | tee -ai log\n```\n![](assets/hooking_log.gif)\n\n### 2. attach\nattach同hooking类似，但是相比hooking少了日志持久化功能，这才是原生frida attach的命令。例如:./attach android_ui.js。以抖音工作目录为例，attach实现如下\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nHOOKER_DRIVER=$(cat ../.hooker_driver)\nfrida $HOOKER_DRIVER -l $1 com.ss.android.ugc.aweme\n```\n\n### 3. spawn\n以spawn模式启动脚本。某些方法在应用启动的时候就初始化了，想要hook这些方法就必须以spawn模式启动了。默认是--no-pause，即不需要手动resume恢复应用。如果需要非--no-pause，请手动编辑spawn文件去除。以抖音工作目录为例，spawn实现如下\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nHOOKER_DRIVER=$(cat ../.hooker_driver)\nfrida $HOOKER_DRIVER --no-pause -f com.ss.android.ugc.aweme -l $1\n```\n\n\n### 4. objection\n快捷执行objection调试命令，执行./objection即可。以抖音工作目录为例，objection实现如下\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nHOOKER_DRIVER=$(cat ../.hooker_driver)\nobjection -d -g com.ss.android.ugc.aweme explore\n```\n![](assets/objection.gif)\n\n### 5. xinitdeploy\nxinitdeploy是用于部署资源的命令，它会把xinit目录下所放的文件拷贝到手机上/data/user/0/{packageName}/xinit/。同时保证资源文件的user/group权限和app进程是同一个临时用户。\n![](assets/xinitdeploy.gif)\n![](assets/xinit_files.png)\n\n### 6. kill\n如果你想重启app，先执行./kill会杀掉应用的主进程和所有子进程。作为一个Andrioid应用开发工程师出身，然后干到后台，接着干到爬虫，现在干到逆向的我必须告诉你：每个手机厂商都会实现一个自己的“内存清理”工具效果不一定好，且可能app本身也有保活机制。所以不建议你通过操作手机滑动进程列表来杀——有可能杀不干净。以抖音工作目录为例，kill实现如下:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\nHOOKER_DRIVER=$(cat ../.hooker_driver)\nfrida-kill $HOOKER_DRIVER com.ss.android.ugc.aweme\n```\n![](assets/kill.gif)\n\n\n### 7. disable_sslpinning\n快速关闭ssl pinning，此命令基于objection源码实现和[frida版just_trust_me](#11-just_trust_mejs)互补。当just_trust_me失效的时候，可以使用disable_sslpinning。反之，使用[just_trust_me](#11-just_trust_mejs)。\n\n![](assets/disable_sslpinning.gif)\n\n\n# 应用工作目录的通杀脚本\n\n### 1. url.js\n需要跟踪url生成时可执行./hooking url.js\n![](assets/hooking_url.gif)\n\n\n### 2. activity_events.js\n当你需要跟踪start某个Activity启动时可执行，获取startActivity的intent信息和调用堆栈。/hooking activity_events.js\n![](assets/activity_events.gif)\n\n### 3. click.js\n跟踪点击事件时可执行，并获取被点击View的真实VClass（很重要）。获取到了Class，你就可以在jadx找到这个View绑定事件代码。多一种办法定位到关键逻辑不好吗？一定要靠分析网络请求吗？条条大路通罗马，不一定非从网络库分析！ /hooking click.js\n![](assets/click.gif)\n\n### 4. android_ui.js\n封装一些操作原生Android UI的函数。如startActivity(activityName)、home()、back()、finishCurrentActivity()、clickByText(text) 等等，命令使用得用attach './attach android_ui.js' 原理是借助radar.dex作为代理操作Android原生View。（tag）\n![](assets/android_ui.gif)\n***\n\n### 5. keystore_dump.js\n在https双向认证的情况下，dump客户端证书为p12。存储位置:/data/user/0/{packagename}/client_keystore_{nowtime}.p12 证书密码: hooker。原理是hook java.security.KeyStore的getPrivateKey和getCertificate方法，因为客户端向服务发送证书必调这个方法。强烈建议keystore_dump.js用spawn模式启动，启动命令为 ./spawn keystore_dump.js 。下面是某app双向认证dump客户端证书过程\n![](assets/https_bothway_01.png)\n![](assets/https_bothway_02.png)\n![](assets/https_bothway_03.png)\n![](assets/https_bothway_04.png)\n\n### 6. edit_text.js\n跟踪获取Editview的getText()事件，并获取Editview的真实Class（很重要）。Editview一般绑定Search Action的实现代码，如果你抓取“搜索”接口。那么这个一定可以帮助你定位发送搜索请求的相关代码。多一种办法定位到关键逻辑不好吗？一定要靠分析网络请求吗？条条大路通罗马，不一定非从网络库分析！\n![](assets/edit_text.png)\n\n### 7. text_view.js\n跟踪TextView的setText和getText，获取TextView的真实Class。一般setText的堆栈信息会带出业务层的数据model处理逻辑，进而进一步分析到业务层数据bean封装类。\n![](assets/text_view.png)\n\n### 8. ssl_log.js\n在native层跟踪ssl握手并记录CLIENT RANDOM，tcpdump出来的链路层pacp里面的TLS包可以用CLIENT RANDOM记录文件解出来，将在高级篇讲解使用步骤。\n\n### 9. object_store.js\n操作ObjectId标识的对象，根据自身分析情况可进行特定的序列化打印、操作对象的私有成员变量。\n实践文章：https://bbs.pediy.com/thread-267245.htm\n\n### 10. hook_RN.js\n对于动态注册的native函数，我们需要用hook_RN.js来分析。强烈建议hook_RN.js用spawn模式启动，启动命令为 ./spawn hook_RN.js\n\n![](assets/hook_RN.gif)\n\n### 11. just_trust_me.js\nfrida版本的just_trust_me。如果你需要bypass sslpinning请执行./spawn just_trust_me.js\n\n下面以Twitter为例，启动just_trust_me.js\n启动演示\n![](assets/strat_just_trust_me.gif)\n\n抓包效果演示\n![](assets/just_trust_me_show.gif)\n\n\n### 12. just_trust_me_okhttp_hook_finder.js\n为配合just_trust_me.js在okhttp混淆场景下辅助你找到混淆点 \njadx打开某资讯apk发现okhttp3如下\n![](assets/qutoutiao.png)\n\n执行./hooking just_trust_me_okhttp_hook_finder.js命令扫描hook点\n```shell\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n原类名：okhttp3.CertificatePinner\n混淆类名：okhttp3.g\n\n\n混淆方法0:\n原方法签名：public

okhttp3.internal.i.d.a(java.lang.String,java.security.cert.X509Certificate)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n根据上面just_trust_me_okhttp_hook_finder.js跑的结果\n把okhttp3的hook点改成混淆的类：\n\n![](assets/okhttp_justhook.png)\n这个提交记录：https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker/commit/f47d2068320a58306735a623f12bd955cbd20632\n\n\n# hooker调试命令行\n\n### a - 打印Activity栈\n打印Activity栈的所有实例，当前界面排最前面。你可以立刻获取当前手机界面的Activity实现类、继承关系、实现接口、Activity中的所有属性值和方法声明。配合jadx动静分析效果最佳，分析Activity对象的内部情况将极快的提供逆向的线索。值得注意的是Activity中每个成员变量hooker会分配一个ObjectId，这是为了让你用c命令对内部成员变量进行扫描的。\n![](assets/a.gif)\n\n\n### b - 打印Service栈\n打印Service栈的所有实例。和a命令一样，获取当前手机界面的Service实现类、继承关系、实现接口、Service中的所有属性值和方法声明。配合jadx动静分析效果最佳，分析Service对象的内部情况将极快的提供逆向的线索。值得注意的是Service中每个成员变量hooker会分配一个ObjectId，这是为了让你用c命令对内部成员变量进行扫描的。\n![](assets/b.gif)\n\n### c - 扫描指定Object\n扫描指定ObjectId的对象，a、b命令扫描Activity和Service带出一托线索。结合jadx观察之成员变量的类型和值情况，你一定可以发现一些新的对象，想窥视之。那么请用c命令扫描吧，而c命令扫描完之后又会带出新的你感兴趣的线索（对象）。顺藤摸瓜，你可以找到很多有趣东西。\n![](assets/c.gif)\n\n### d - 展开Object[]、List或Map\n展开一个Object[]、List或Map，并以Index/key->value的形式打印出来，从而进一步获取集合对象内部的每个对象类型和ObjectId。比如我们通过a命令查看某Activity发现属性o是一个Fragment数组'name:o\tstatic:false\tfromExtends:false\ttype:[Landroidx.fragment.app.Fragment; objectId:tGErGHXLso\tvalue:[Landroidx.fragment.app.Fragment;@94023208'，那么这个数组里面每个成员是什么我们就可以用d命令对其进行展开了。\n![](assets/d.png)\n\n### v - 以View的方式查看对象\n以View的方式查看一个对象，除了有c命令全部的功能之外。v命令会先强转对象为View,然后获取view绑定的OnClickListener、OnLongClickListener、OnTouchListener、OnFocusChangeListener、OnEditorActionListener、OnItemClickListener等等，这些对象也将完全探测出来。比如对于属性:'name:h\tstatic:false\tfromExtends:false\ttype:com.ttpc.bidding_hall.weight.HomeTabButton\tviewId:2131297762\tobjectId:GKuWPZOyY0\tvalue:com.ttpc.bidding_hall.weight.HomeTabButton@227103246' 如下图用v命令查看我们可以发现HomeTabButton绑定了一个点击事件com.ttpai.track.g，这样的话你去jadx找到这个类就知道处理这个按钮的逻辑啦！！！此外，v 命令还可以跟上ViewId，但是ViewId对于每个View不一定都存在并且也不一定唯一，这个具体细节可以了解Android应用开发。\n![](assets/v.png)\n\n### e - 检测类在内存中是否存在\n检测一个类在内存中是否存在。大部分情况下静态分析的类在内存中会存在，但是有时app会做热更新可能会出现类被替换的情况。作为一个严谨的逆向工程师在对类进行操作之前检测类是否存在内存中是个好习惯。如：e com.bytedance.frameworks.encryptor.EncryptorUtil 输出：True表示存在 False表示不存在\n![](assets/exists_class.gif)\n\n### s - 正则表达式扫描类\n用正则表达式在内存中扫描类。比如你对某些关键词类感兴趣，完全可以使用s进行扫描。配合jadx查看类实现代码爽歪歪！当然jadx自带类搜索功能但是只是静态的，并且jadx搜索功能是吃内存的，没有32G内存使用起来好卡。这时候s命令或许你是不错的选择。\n![](assets/s.png)\n\n### j - 生成指定类的hook脚本\n生成指定类名称的hook脚本，也是hooker最核心的功能之一。相比objection，hooker生成的脚本有标注生产脚本的apk版本和类名。并且每个方法内部已经具备打印堆栈的功能，包括调用时间、线程id、线程名、调用对象的hashcode，调用方法用时都有很详细的描述。\n![](assets/j0.png)\n![](assets/j1.png)\n![](assets/j2.png)\n此脚本参考[RequestEncryptUtils.js](com.ss.android.ugc.aweme/com.bytedance.frameworks.core.encrypt.RequestEncryptUtils.js \"RequestEncryptUtils.js\")\n\nhooker生成脚本和objection生成脚本优势对比\n\n| 项目        | 生成脚本命令   |  能否打印堆栈  |  包含辅助方法  |  脚本版本信息注释  |  脚本可定制性  |\n| --------   | -----:  | :----:  | :----:  | :----:  | :----:

\"http://www.example.com/login?\"+ \"sign=\" + getSign();\n```\n\n以上代码编译后会生成如下\n\n```java\nString url = new StringBuilder(\"http://www.example.com/login?\").append(\"sign=\").append(getSign()).toString();\n```\n\n不过这个思路有点儿类似暴力破解，而且非常影响app进程的运行速度，崩溃也是可能的。我的认为只要能搞出一些线索，崩溃也是值得的。崩溃我重启就是了。你觉得呢？\n\n\n\nhooker高级应用\n=================\n\n## radar.dex\n在hooker根目录中有一个radar.dex，这是为操作java类的增强库。\n\n## 脚本的内置函数\n脚本是frida的核心，一个脚本不能只做打印堆栈信息的事情。我们还要进一步深挖脚本的潜在价值。比如我们改变被hook对象的内部成员变量的值、直接调用对象的方法、patch我们的dex。所以在hooker生成的每个脚本当中，我还内置了你可能需要用到的方法用于定制脚本。下面我就开始介绍这些方法的作用吧。\n\n### 1. loadDexfile(dexfile)\n加载一个dex文件到app进程中。dexfile是dex在手机上绝对路径，调用此方法必须保证dex文件用户和组权限对app进程的可见性。\n\n### 2. checkLoadDex(className， dexfile)\n先检测className是否存在内存中，如果不存在加载一个dex文件到app进程中。dexfile是dex在手机上绝对路径，调用此方法必须保证dex文件用户和组权限对app进程的可见性。\n\n### 3. loadXinitDexfile(dexfile)\n加载一个dex文件到app进程中。与loadDexfile、checkLoadDex不同，此方法直接从/data/user/0/{packageName}/xinit/路径下找dex文件。比如我们要加载上面基于[xinitdeploy](#4-xinitdeploy)命令部署的patch.dex，直接loadXinitDexfile(\"patch.dex\");就可以给app进程注入dex了。到了这里你明白[xinitdeploy](#4-xinitdeploy)的良苦用心了没有！\n\n### 4. loadXRadarDexfile()\n加载radar.dex文件到app进程中。radar.dex内部包含操作java对象的增强功能，如果你需要使用fastTojson、getPrettyString、storeObjectAndLog等方法，必需在脚本加载时调用一次loadXRadarDexfile()。\n\n### 5. fastTojson(javaObject)\n基于radar.dex中fastjson序列化一个java对象为json字符串。该方法依赖radar.dex，使用前必须loadXRadarDexfile()。注意loadXRadarDexfile()进行一次即可，无需多次调用。\n\n### 6. getPrettyString(javaObject)\n类似与toString()，与toString()不同的是它将判断子类是否实现toString方法，如果没有现实toString或者类是android.os.Parcelable可能会引起循环调用的异常，所以getPrettyString会根据情况采用[className]@[hashCode]的方法来规避。该方法依赖radar.dex，使用前必须loadXRadarDexfile()。注意loadXRadarDexfile()进行一次即可，无需多次调用。\n\n### 7. getField(javaObject, fieldName)\n获取对象的属性，这是来弥补frida语法中this.a.b.c.d深度查找的不足。该方法依赖radar.dex，使用前必须loadXRadarDexfile()。注意loadXRadarDexfile()进行一次即可，无需多次调用。\n\n在frida中深度查找是不支持的，以下方式获取对象将发生错误。\n```js\nlet d = this.a.b.c.d;\n```\n所以你可以使用getField(javaObject, fieldName)来替代以上的逻辑\n```js\nlet aObj = getField(this, \"a\");\nlet bObj = getField(aObj, \"b\");\nlet cObj = getField(bObj, \"c\");\nlet dObj = getField(cObj, \"d\");\n```\n\n### 8. storeObjectAndLog(javaObject)\n将对象存储至对象缓存中，同时输出对象缓存id。然后你可以用c [objectId]，扫描对象，这将帮助你更好的窥视内存。该方法依赖radar.dex，使用前必须loadXRadarDexfile()。注意loadXRadarDexfile()进行一次即可，无需多次调用。\n\n## 原生ui自动化\nhooker借助radar.dex中gz.radar.AndroidUI的实现，将代码直接打到app进程当中实现直接操作View对象。这种效率已经超越了所有的三方自动化框架，因为无论哪种自动化框架都是基于C/S架构的，而hooker通过打补丁的方式是直接侵入式的修改app内部的代码逻辑。\n\n不过android_ui.js只是一个ui简单操作的体验工具，更高效的ui操作还是要结合每个应用实际情况定制patch代码。\n\n应用工作目录输入后./attach android_ui.js进入ui操作命令行，你可以操作以下几个方法\n\n### 1. startActivity(activityName)\n不传intent和action，强制启动一个Activity。比如，2020年4月份某信刚上视频号功能的时候，我的微信小号没有体验资格——也就是没有\"视频号\"那个按钮，不给我按钮我就启动不了了吗？按钮背后的逻辑就是执行了一个startActivity的操作，所以我就实现了这个方法————强制启动v信视频号的搜索界面。\n\n```js\nstartActivity(\"com.tencent.mm.plugin.finder.search.FinderFeedSearchUI\")\n```\n\n不过startActivity不一定成功，因为应用很多Activity都需要特定的intent和action，这个在应用的AndroidManifest.xml中有定义，另外你还有结合[activity_events.js](#2-activity_eventsjs)去参照原来的启动代码。比如我要强制打开一个用户资料的Activity，那你必须传一个userid或者uid什么数据给他，而且你还得知道它定义的数据方式。这时候你需要定位原来启动Activity代码，这就是[activity_events.js](#2-activity_eventsjs)的意义所在。比如，下面经过我的分析启动某一视频号作者主页面的代码应该这样实现。\n\n```java\nIntent intent = new Intent();\nintent.putExtra(\"finder_username\", username);\ncom.tencent.mm.plugin.finder.g.a aVar = com.tencent.mm.plugin.finder.g.a.pPL;\ncom.tencent.mm.plugin.finder.g.a.enterFinderProfileUI(Android.getTopActivity(), intent);\n```\n\n### 2. contextStartActivity(activityName)\ncontextStartActivity与startActivity不同，它会先获取应用的context。然后调用context的startActivity方法。\n\n### 3. topActivityStartActivity(activityName)\ntopActivityStartActivity先获取栈顶的Activity实例，然后调用实例的startActivity方法。startActivity就是topActivityStartActivity。\n\n### 4. home()\n模拟点击home按钮\n\n### 5. back()\n模拟点击back按钮\n\n### 6. finishCurrentActivity()\n退出栈顶Activity。原理是先获取栈顶的Activity实例，然后调用其finish()方法来主动结束。\n\n### 7. clickByText(text)\n点击包含text文本的按钮。如果界面上存在多个包含text的按钮会优先选择找到的第一个。\n\n### 8. clickById(id)\n点击指定view id的按钮。你可以用uiautomatorviewer查看viewid，也可以用viewTree()方法输出view的json树来找到你要的元素。uiautomatorviewer在你{AndroidSdk}/tools/bin/路径下。\n\n### 9. hover(x,y,upStepLength)\n滑动屏幕。x,y传数字表示按下坐标，upStepLength的绝对值是步长表示滑动的长度。当upStepLength为正数的时候表示要向上滑动，当upStepLength为负数的时候表示向下滑动。\n\n### 10. viewTree()\n获取json格式的view树\n\n![](assets/android_ui_view_tree2.gif)\n![](assets/android_ui_view_tree.png)\n此ViewTree结果参考[viewTree.json](com.ss.android.ugc.aweme/viewTree.json \"viewTree.json\")\n\n\n\n\n## 远程frida支持\n在hooker根目录有一个.hooker_driver文件，内容默认是-U表示通过usb连接frida-server。\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ cat .hooker_driver \n-U\n```\n如果你的frida-server绑定在0.0.0.0:27042，并且你需要远程连接的话。你需要知晓你的手机局域网ip比如是192.168.0.105，则把.hooker_driver改为如下内容即可实现hooker全局远程调试。\n```shell\nstephen@ubuntu:~/hooker$ cat .hooker_driver \n-H 192.168.0.105:27042\n```\n\n\n# 更新教程\nhooker没有版本的概念，更新可以采用两种方式。建议每周一更，更新步骤建议采用如下操作顺序\n\n### 1. clone最新项目\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker.git\n```\n如果git clone比较慢，你可以下载文件解压https://github.com/CreditTone/hooker/archive/refs/heads/master.zip\n\n### 2. 方式一覆盖核心文件到你的hooker\n此种方式适用于你有自己的hooker本地仓库，所以只覆盖最新hooker的核心功能文件是便于你管理自己的hooker的。\n执行以下命令将核心文件覆盖到你本地的hooker\n\n```shell\nexport LATEST_HOOKER=~/Download/hooker #这里要设置你下载的最新hooker目录\nexport MY_HOOKER=~/hooker #这里要设置你的hooker目录\n\n#上面两个环境变量改好之后，下面的命令可以照抄\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/hooker $MY_HOOKER/hooker\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/hooker.py $MY_HOOKER/hooker.py\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/radar.dex $MY_HOOKER/radar.dex\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/run_env.py $MY_HOOKER/run_env.py\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/xinitdeploy.py $MY_HOOKER/xinitdeploy.py\ncp -f $LATEST_HOOKER/spider.py $MY_HOOKER/spider.py\ncp -f

$MY_HOOKER/mobile-deploy/\n```\n### 3. 方式二覆盖你的应用工作目录到最新hooker\n如果你不需要维护自己的hooker版本，就可以用这个方式。简单粗暴！\n\n```shell\nexport LATEST_HOOKER=~/Download/hooker #这里要设置你下载的最新hooker目录\nexport MY_HOOKER=~/hooker #这里要设置你的hooker目录\n\n#你有多少个目录就拷贝多少个吧\ncp -rf $MY_HOOKER/{your_app_package} $LATEST_HOOKER/ \n```\n\nhooker实战应用\n=================\n\n### ssl_log链路层离线抓包\n\n###

    "text" : "# A Simple Framework For Mobile System Design Interviews (work in progress)\nBelow is a simple framework for Mobile System Design interviews. As an example, we are going to use the \"Design Twitter Feed\" question. The proposed solution is far from being perfect but it is not the point of a system design interview round: no one expects you to build a robust system in just 30 min - the interviewer is mostly looking for specific \"signals\" from your thought process and communication. Everything you say or do should showcase your strengths and help the interviewer to evaluate you as a candidate.  \n  \nJoin the [\"Mobile System Design\"](https://discord.gg/AWDNrvqban) Discord server for general discussions and feedback.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  \n[<img height=\"60\" alt=\"discord\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/786644/91370247-cf4cea80-e7db-11ea-8330-dc29c0fe8969.png\">](https://discord.gg/AWDNrvqban)\n  \n</div>\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe framework was heavily inspired by the similar \"Scalable Backend Design\" articles. Learning the framework does not guarantee passing the interview. The structure of the interview process depends on the personal style of the interviewer. The dialog is really important - make sure you understand what the interviewer is looking for. Make no assumptions and ask clarifying questions.  \n\n**This guide does not reflect the interviewing policies from Google (or any other company).**\n\n## Interview Process (45–60 min)\n- 2–5 min - acquaintances\n- 5 min - defining the task and gathering requirements\n- 10 min - high-level discussion\n- 20-30 min - detailed discussion\n- 5 min - questions to the interviewer\n\n## Acquaintances\nYour interviewer tells you about themselves and you tell them about yourself. It's better to keep it simple and short. For example, _\"My name is Alex, I've been working on iOS/Android since 2010 - mostly on frameworks and libraries. For the past 2.5 years, I've been leading a team on an XYZ project: my responsibilities include system design, planning and technical mentoring.\"_ The only purpose of the introduction is to break the ice and provide a gist of your background. The more time you spend on this, the less time you will have for the actual interview.\n\n## Defining The Task\nThe interviewer defines the task. For example: _\"Design Twitter Feed\"_.  Your first step is to figure out the scope of the task:\n- **Client-side only** -  just a client-app: you have the backend and API available.\n- **Client-side + API**  -  likely choice for most interviews: you need to design a client app and API.\n- **Client-side + API + Back-end** -  less likely choice since most mobile engineers would not have a proper backend experience. If the interviewer asks server-side questions - let them know that you're most comfortable with the client-side and don't have hands-on experience with backend infrastructure. It's better to be honest than trying to fake your knowledge. If they still persist - let them know that everything you know comes from books, YouTube videos, and blog posts.\n\n## Gathering Requirements\nTask requirements can be split into **functional**, **non-functional** and **out of scope**.  We'll define them in the scope of \"Design Twitter Feed\" task.\n### Functional requirements\nThink about 3–5 features that would bring _the biggest value to the business_.\n- Users should be able to scroll through an infinite list of tweets.\n- Users should be able to like a tweet.\n- Users should be able to open a tweet and see comments (read-only).\n\n### Non-functional requirements\nNot immediately visible to a user but plays an important role for the product in general.\n- Offline support.\n- Real-time notifications.\n- Optimal bandwidth and CPU/Battery usage.\n\n### Out of scope\nFeatures which will be excluded from the task but would still be important in a real project.\n- Login/Authentication.\n- Tweet sending.\n- Followers/Retweets.\n- Analytics.\n\n### Providing the \"signal\"\nSystem design questions are made ambiguous. The interviewer is more interested in seeing your thought process than the actual solution you produce:\n- What assumptions did you make and how did you state them?\n- What features did you choose?\n- What clarifying questions did you ask?\n- What concerns and trade-offs did you mention?\n\nYour best bet is to ask many questions and cover as much ground as possible. Make it clear that you're starting with the BFS approach and ask them which feature or component they want to dig in. Some interviewers would let you choose which topics you want to discuss :  pick something you know best.\n\n## Clarifying Questions\nHere are some of the questions you might ask during the task clarification step\n- **Do we need to support Emerging Markets?**  \nPublishing in a developing country brings additional challenges. The app size should be as small as possible due to the widespread use of low-end devices and higher cost of cellular traffic. The app itself should limit the number and the frequency of network requests and heavily rely on caching.\n- **What number of users do we expect?**  \nThis seems like an odd question for a mobile engineer but it can be very important: a large number of clients results in a higher back-end load  -  if you don't design your API right , you can easily initiate a DDoS attack on your own servers. Make sure to discuss an Exponential Backoff and API Rate-Limiting with your interviewer.\n- **How big is the engineering team?**  \nThis question might make sense for senior candidates. Building a product with a smaller team (2–4 engineers) is very different from building it with a larger team (20–100 engineers). The major concern is project structure and modularization. You need to design your system in a way that allows multiple people to work on it without stepping on each other's toes.\n\n## High-Level Diagram\nOnce your interviewer is satisfied with the clarification step and your choice for the system requirements  - you should ask if they want to see a high-level diagram. Below is a possible solution for the \"Twitter Feed\" question.\n![High-level Diagram](/images/twitter-feed-high-level-diagram.svg)\n\n### Server-side components:\n- **Backend**  \nRepresents the whole server-sider infrastructure. Most likely, your interviewer won't be interested in discussing it.\n- **Push Provider**  \nRepresents the Mobile Push Provider infrastructure. Receives push payloads from the Backend and delivers them to clients.\n- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**  \nResponsible for delivering static content to clients.\n### Client-side components:\n- **API Service**  \nAbstracts client-server communications from the rest of the system.\n- **Persistence**  \nA single source of truth. The data your system receives gets persisted on the disk first and then propagated to other components.\n- **Repository**  \nA mediator component between API Service and Persistence.\n- **Tweet Feed Flow**  \nRepresents a set of components responsible for displaying an infinite scrollable list of tweets.\n- **Tweet Details Flow**  \nRepresents a set of components responsible for displaying a single tweet's details.\n- **DI Graph**  \nDependency injection graph. _TBD_.\n- **Image Loader**  \nResponsible for loading and caching static images. Usually represented by a 3rd-party library.\n- **Coordinator**  \nOrganizes flow logic between Tweet Feed and Tweet Details components. Helps decoupling components of the system from each other.\n- **App Module**  \nAn executable part of the system which \"glues\" components together.\n\n### Providing the \"signal\"\nThe interviewer might be looking for the following signals:\n- The candidate can present the \"big picture\" without overloading it with unnecessary implementation details.\n- The candidate can identify the major building blocks of the system and how they communicate with each other.\n- The candidate has app modularity in mind and is capable of thinking in the scope of the entire team and not limiting themselves as a single contributor (this might be more important for senior candidates).\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n#### Why using a high-level diagram is necessary? Can I skip it altogether or draw a detailed diagram right away?\nA high-level diagram is by no means necessary - you can take any other approach which seems more appropriate for a specific interview case. However, there are some advantages in starting with a high-level approach:\n- **Time management** - drawing a 30,000 feet view is quick and brings immediate topics for further discussion.\n- **Modularity** - each high-level component can be potentially isolated in a separate module to allow a team of engineers to work on the project simultaneity without stepping on each other toes.\n- **Best practices** - this approach is wildly used for the backend system design and closely resembles the [C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/).  \n\n_Still not sure?_ Ask your interviewer if they want you to draw a high-level diagram or skip it and jump to some concrete components.\n\n## Deep Dive: Tweet Feed Flow\nAfter a high-level discussion, your interviewer might steer the conversation towards some specific component of the system. Let's assume it was \"Tweet Feed Flow\". Things you might want to talk about:\n- **Architecture patterns**: MVP, MVVM, MVI, etc. MVC is considered a poor choice these days. It's better to select a well known pattern since it makes it easier to onboard new hires (compared to some less known home-grown approaches).\n- **Pagination**: essential for an infinite scroll functionality. For more details see Pagination.\n- **Dependency injection**: helps building an isolated and testable module.\n- **Image Loading**: low-res vs full-res image loading, scrolling performance, etc.\n\n![Details Diagram](/images/tweet-details.svg)\n### Components\n- **Feed API Service** - abstracts Twitter Feed API client: provides the functionality for requesting paginated data from the backend. Injected via DI-graph.\n- **Feed Persistence** - abstract cached paginated data storage. Injected via DI-graph.\n- **Remote Mediator** - triggers fetching the next/prev page of data. Redirects the newly fetched paged response into a persistence layer.\n- **Feed Repository** - consolidates remote and cached responses into a Pager object through Remote Mediator.\n- **Pager** - trigger data fetching from the Remote Mediator and exposes an observable stream of paged data to UI.\n- **\"Tweet Like\" and \"Tweet Details\" use cases** - provide delegated implementation for \"Like\" and \"Show Details\" operations. Injected via DI-graph.\n- **Image Loader** - abstracts image loading from the image loading library. Injected via DI-graph.\n\n### Providing the \"signal\"\nThe interviewer might be looking for the following signals:\n- The candidate is familiar with most common MVx patterns.\n- The candidate achieves a clear separation between business logic and UI.\n- The candidate is familiar with dependency injection methods.\n- The candidate is capable of designing self-contained isolated modules.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### How much detail should I provide in the deep-dive section?\"\nThere's no rule of thumb here. Work closely with the interviewer: ask them if you need to go deeper or move on to the next topic. If you have an in-person/video interview - watch their facial expressions. For example, if you see that the interviewer wants to interrupt you - stop talking and ask if they have any questions. The whole point is to work together - that provides a good signal for you as a team player/collaborator.\n\n#### Why didn't you mention specific classes (like `RecyclerView`/`UICollectionView`) and vendors (like Room, CoreDate, Realm, etc)?\n- To make the guide stable and platform-agnostic: the libraries and the frameworks are constantly evolving - picking up a specific vendor can only be relevant for a short amount of time. Using an abstraction is more robust since you only concentrate on the functionality it provides without digging too much into the implementation details.\n- Vendor selection is biased and depends on personal experience and current trends.\n- Big tech companies (like FAANG) might not care much about vendors since they build their custom proprietary stacks.\n- There are tons of implementation-specific details all over the Internet already.\n\n#### What drawing tool should I use?\nAt the time of this writing - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/), and [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) could be the most popular choice. Some interviewers would skip diagramming altogether and prefer a collaborative editor and a verbal discussion. Due to privacy issues, some companies would not let the candidate share the screen and use a tool of personal choice.\n\n## API Design\nThe goal is to cover as much ground as possible - you won't have enough time to cover every API call - just ask the interviewer if they are particulary interested in a specific part, or choose something you know best (in case they don't have a strong preference).\n### Real-time notification\nWe need to provide real-time notifications support as a part of the design. Bellow are some of the approaches you can mention during the discussion:\n- **Push Notifications**:\n  - pros:\n    - easier to implement compared to a dedicated service.\n    - can wake the app in the background.\n  - cons:\n    - not 100% reliable.\n    - may take up to a minute to arrive.\n    - relies on a 3rd-party service.\n    - users can opt out easily.\n- **HTTP-polling**  \nPolling requires the client to periodically ask the server for updates. The biggest concern is the amount of unnecessary network traffic and increased backend load.\n  - **short polling**: the client samples the server with a predefined time interval.    \n    - pros:\n      - simple and not as expensive (if the time between requests is long).\n      - no need to keep a persistent connection.\n    - cons:\n      - the notification can be delayed for as long as the polling time interval.\n      - additional overhead due to TLS Handshake and HTTP-headers \n  - **long polling**:\n     - pros:\n       - instant notification (no additional delay).\n     - cons:\n       - more complex and requires more server-side resources.\n       - keeps a persistent connection until the server replies.\n- **Server-Sent Events**  \nAllows the client to stream events over an HTTP connection without polling.\n  - pros:\n    - real-time traffic using a single connection.\n  - cons:\n    - keeps a persistent connection.\n- **Web-Sockets**:  \nProvide a bi-directional communication between client and server.\n  - pros:\n    - can transmit both binary and text data.\n  - cons:\n    - more complex to set-up compared to Polling/SSE.\n    - keeps a persistent connection.\n\nThe interviewer would expect you to **pick a concrete approach** most suitable for the design task at hand. One possible solution for the \"Design Twitter Feed\" question could be using a combination of SSE (a primary channel of receiving real-time updates on \"likes\") with Push Notifications (sent if the client does not have an active connection to the backend).\n\n### Protocols\n#### REST\nA text-based stateless protocol - most popular choice for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.\n- pros:\n  - easy to learn, understand, and implement.\n  - easy to cache using built-in HTTP caching mechanism.\n  - loose coupling between client and server.\n- cons:\n  - less efficient on mobile platforms since every request requires a separate physical connection.\n  - schemaless - it's hard to check data validity on the client.\n  - stateless - needs extra functionality to maintain a session.\n  - additional overhead - every request contains contextual metadata and headers.\n\n#### GraphQL\nA query language for working with API - allows clients to request data from several resources using a single endpoint (instead of making multiple requests in traditional RESTful apps).\n- pros:\n  - schema-based typed queries - clients can verify data integrity and format.\n  - highly customizable - clients can request specific data and reduce the amount of HTTP-traffic.\n  - bi-directional communication with GraphQL Subscriptions (WebSocket based).\n- cons:\n  - more complex backend implementation.\n  - \"leaky-abstraction\" - clients become tightly coupled to the backend.\n  - the performance of a query is bound to the performance of the slowest service on the backend (in case the response data is federated between multiple services).\n\n#### WebSocket\nFull-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.\n- pros:\n  - real time bi-directional communication.\n  - provides both text-based and binary traffic.\n- cons:\n  - requires maintaining an active connection - might have poor performance on unstable cellular networks.\n  - schemaless - it's hard to check data validity on the client.\n  - the number of active connections on a single server is limited to 65k.\n\nLearn more about WebSockets:\n- [WebSocket Tutorial - How WebSockets Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNxK8fPKstc)\n\n#### gRPC\nRemote Procedure Call framework which runs on top of HTTP/2. Supports bi-directional streaming using a single physical connection.\n- pros:\n  - lightweight binary messages (much smaller compared to text-based protocols).\n  - schema-based - built-in code generation with Protobuf.\n  - provides support of event-driven architecture: server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bi-directional streaming\n  - multiple parallel requests.\n- cons:\n  - limited browser support.\n  - non human-readable format.\n  - steeper learning curve.\n\nThe interviewer would expect you to **pick a concrete approach** most suitable for the design task at hand. Since the API layer for the \"Design Twitter Feed\" question is pretty simple and does not require much customization - we can select an approach based on REST.\n\n### Pagination\nEndpoints that return a list of entities must support pagination. Without pagination, a single request could return a huge amount of results causing excessive network and memory usage.\n#### Types of pagination\n- **Offset Pagination**  \nProvides a `limit` and an `offset` query parameters. Example: `GET /feed?offset=100&limit=20`.\n  - pros:\n    - easiest to implement - the request parameters can be passed directly to a SQL query.\n    - stateless on the server.\n  - cons:\n    - bad performance on large offset values (the database needs to skip `offset` rows before returning the paginated result).\n    - inconsistent when adding new rows into the database (Page Drift).\n- **Keyset Pagination**  \nUses the values from the last page to fetch the next set of items. Example: `GET /feed?after=2021-05-25T00:00:00&limit=20`.\n  - pros:\n    - translates easily into a SQL query.\n    - good performance with large datasets.\n    - stateless on the server.\n  - cons:\n    - \"leaky abstraction\" - the pagination mechanism becomes aware of the underlying database storage.\n    - only works on fields with natural ordering (timestamps, etc).\n- **Cursor/Seek Pagination**  \nOperates with stable ids which are decoupled from the database SQL queries (usually, a selected field is encoded using base64 and encrypted on the backend side). Example: `GET /feed?after_id=t1234xzy&limit=20`.\n  - pros:\n    - decouples pagination from SQL database.\n    - consistent ordering when new items are inserted.\n  - cons:\n    - more complex backend implementation.\n    - does not work well if items get deleted (ids might become invalid).\n\nYou need to select a single approach after listing the possible options and discussing their pros and cons. We'll pick Cursor Pagination in the scope of the \"Design Twitter Feed\" question. A sample API request might look like this:  \n```\nGET /v1/feed?after_id=p1234xzy&limit=20\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"t123\",\n        \"author_id\": \"a123\",\n        \"title\": \"Title\",\n        \"description\": \"Description\",\n        \"likes\": 12345,\n        \"comments\": 10,\n        \"attachments\": {\n          \"media\": [\n            {\n              \"image_url\": \"https://static.cdn.com/image1234.webp\",\n              \"thumb_url\": \"https://static.cdn.com/thumb1234.webp\"\n            },\n            ...\n          ]\n        },\n        \"created_at\": \"2021-05-25T17:59:59.000Z\"\n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"count\": 20,\n    \"next_id\": \"p1235xzy\",\n    \"prev_id\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n#### Additional Information\n- [Evolving API Pagination at Slack](https://slack.engineering/evolving-api-pagination-at-slack/)  \n- [Everything You Need to Know About API Pagination](https://nordicapis.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-pagination/)  \n\nAlthough we left it out of scope, it's still beneficial to mention HTTP authentication. You can include an `Authorization` header and discuss how to properly handle `401 Unauthorized` response scenario. Also, don't forget to talk about Rate-Limiting strategies (`429 Too Many Requests`).  \nMake sure to keep it brief and simple (without unnecessary details): your primary goal during a system design interview is to provide \"signal\" and not to build a production ready solution.\n\n### Providing the \"signal\"\nThe interviewer might be looking for the following signals:\n- The candidate is aware of the challenges related to poor network conditions and expensive traffic.\n- The candidate is familiar with most common protocols for unidirectional and bi-directional communication.\n- The candidate is familiar with REST-full API design.\n- The candidate is familiar with authentication and security best practices.\n- The candidate is familiar with network error handling and rate-limiting.\n\n## Data Storage\n### Data Storage Options\nBellow are the most common options for local device data storage:\n- **Key-Value Storage (UserDefaults/SharedPreferences/Property List)**:  \n  Usually, baked by XML or binary files. Allows associating primitive data with string-based keys. Works best for simple, unstructured, non-sensitive data (settings, flags, etc).  \n  - pros:\n    - easy to use built-in API.\n  - cons:\n    - insecure (Android provides [EncryptedSharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences); 3rd party wrapper libraries available on iOS).\n    - not suitable for storing large data.\n    - no schema support nor ability to query data.\n    - no data migration support.\n    - poor performance.\n- **Database/ORM (sqlite/Room/Core Data/Realm/etc)**:  \n  Based on a relational database. Perfect for large amounts of structured data that needs complex querying logic.  \n  - pros:\n    - object–relational mapping support. \n    - schema and querying support.\n    - data migration support.\n  - cons:\n    - more complex setup. \n    - insecure (wrapper libraries available on iOS/Android).\n    - bigger memory footprint.\n- **Custom/Binary (DataStore/NSCoding/Codable/etc)**:  \n  Handles storing and loading data on a low level. Works best when you need to customize the data storage pipeline.  \n  - pros:\n    - highly customizable.\n    - performant.\n  - cons:\n    - no schema/migration support.\n    - lots of manual effort.\n- **On-Device Secure Storage (Keystore/Key Chain)**:  \n  Use OS-encrypted storage for creating/storing encryption keys and key-value data.  \n  - pros:\n    - secure (not 100% unless provided by the hardware).\n  - cons:\n    - not optimized for storing anything but encryption keys.\n    - encryption/decryption performance overhead.\n    - no schema/migration support.\n### Storage Location\n- **Internal**  \n  Sand-boxed by the app and not readable to other apps (with few exceptions).\n- **External**  \n  Publicly visible and most likely not deleted when your app is deleted.\n- **Media/Scoped**  \n  Special type of storage for media files.\n### Storage Type\n- **Documents (Automatically Backed Up)**  \n  User-generated data that cannot be easily re-generated and will be automatically backed up.\n- **Cache**  \n  Data that can be downloaded again or regenerated. Can be deleted by user to free-up space.\n- **Temp**  \n  Data that is only used temporary and should be deleted when no longer needed. \n\n### Best Practices\n- Store as little sensitive data as possible.\n- Use encrypted storage if you can't avoid storing sensitive data.\n- Do not allow your app storage grow uncontrollably. Make sure that cleaning up cached files won't affect app functionality.\n\n### Approach\nYou need to select a single approach after listing options and discussing their pros and cons. Don't worry about building a complete solution - just try to lay out a high-level idea without going too deep into details.  \nA possible breakdown for the \"Design Twitter Feed\" question might look like this:\n#### Feed Pagination Table\nCreate a \"feed\" database table for storing paginated feed response:\n```\nitem_id:        String\nauthor_id:      String\ntitle:          String\ndescription:    String\nlikes:          Int\ncomments:       Int\nattachments:    String # comma separated list\ncreated_at:     Date   # also used for sorting\ncursor_next_id: String # points to the next cursor page\ncursor_prev_id: String # points to the prev cursor page\n```\n- Limit the total number of entries to 500 in order to control local storage size.\n- Flatten attachments into a comma separated list. Alternatively, you can create an `attachments` table and join it with the `feed` table on `item_id`.\n- Explicitly store next/prev cursor id with each item to simplify paged navigation.\n\n#### Attachments Storage\n- Store attachments as files in Internal Cached storage.\n- Use attachment URLs as cache keys.\n- Delete attachments after deleting corresponding items from the `feed` table.\n- Limit the cache size to 200-400 Mb.\n\nA possible follow-up question might require you to handle sensitive media data (private accounts, etc). In this case, you can selectively encrypt image files with encryption keys stored in Keystore/KeyChain.\n\n### Providing the \"signal\"\nThe interviewer might be looking for the following signals:\n- The candidate is aware of mobile storage types, security, limitations, and compatibility.\n- The candidate is capable of designing a storage solution for most common scenarios.\n\n## Additional topics\n### Major Concerns For Mobile Development\nHere's a list of concerns to keep in mind while discussing your solution with the interviewer:\n- **User Data Privacy** - leaking customer data can damage your business and reputation.\n- **Security** - protect your products against reverse-engineering (more important for Android).\n- **Target Platform Changes** - each new iOS/Android release may limit an existing functionality and make Privacy rules more strict.\n- **Non-reversibility of released products** - assume everything you ship is final and would never change. Make sure to use staged rollouts and server-side \"feature\" flags.\n- **Performance/Stability**\n  - Metered data usage - cellular network traffic can be very expensive.\n  - Bandwidth usage - constant waking up of the cellular radio results in a faster battery drain.\n  - CPU usage - higher computational load results in a faster battery drain and device overheating.\n  - Memory Usage - higher memory usage increases the risk of the app being killed in the background.\n  - Startup Time - doing too much work at the app start creates a poor user experience.\n  - Crashers/ANRs - doing too much work on the main thread can lead to app shutdowns and UI-jank. App crashes is the leading factor of poor store ratings. \n- **Geo-Location Usage**\n  - Don't compromise user privacy while using location services.  \n  - Prefer the lowest possible location accuracy. Progressively ask for increased location accuracy if needed.  \n  - Provide location access rationale before requesting permissions.  \n- **3rd-Party SDKs Usage**  \n  - 3rd-Party SDKs might cause performance regressions and/or serious outages ([example](https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/sdks-should-not-crash-apps)).  \n  - Each SDK should be guarded by a feature flag.\n  - A new SDK integration should be introduced as an A/B test or a staged rollout.  \n  - You need to have a \"support and upgrade\" plan for the 3rd-party SDKs in a long term.\n\n### Privacy & Security\n- Keep as little of the user's data as possible - don't collect things you won't need.\n  - Avoid collecting device IDs (prefer one-time generated pseudo-anonymous IDs).\n  - Anonymize collected data.\n- Minimize the use of permissions\n  - Be prepared for the user to deny permissions and respect the user's choice when they deny permission the second time.\n  - Be prepared for the system to auto-reset permissions.\n  - Be prepared for app hibernation of unused apps.\n  - Delegate functionality to the 1st party apps (Camera, Photo Picker, File Manager, etc).\n- Assume that on-device storage is not secure (even while using KeyStore/KeyChain functionality).\n- Assume that the backend storage is also not secure - discussed possible end-to-end encryption mechanisms.\n- Assume that the target platform's (iOS/Android) Security & Privacy rules will change - make critical functionality controllable by remote \"feature\" flags.\n- User's _perception_ of security is as important as the implemented security measures - make sure to discuss how you would educate your customers about data collection, storage, and transmission.\n\n#### Cloud vs On-Device\nAt some point, during the interview, you might need to choose between running some functionality on a device and moving it to a cloud. The approach you select would have the biggest impact when it comes to _On-Device AI_ but can also be extended to any kind of data processing as well.  \n\n**Advantages of running things in a cloud:**\n- Device-independent - your customers are not limited by the characteristics of their devices.\n- Better usage of client system resources - any intensive computation can be executed on the backend to save the device's battery.\n- The fast pace of changes - you don't need to release an update to all the clients in order to get the desired functionality available.\n- Much bigger computational resources - your backend can autoscale as the load pressure grows.\n- Better security - the client code can be tampered and reverse engineered while the backend applications tend to be more secure.\n- Easier analytics and offline data analysis - you gather all the data you need in your data centers.\n\n**Advantages of running things on a device:**\n- Better privacy - the data does not leave the user's device and is not stored on the cloud.\n- Real-time functionality - certain operations can run much faster on a user's device than being sent to a backend.\n- Lower bandwidth usage - you don't need to send data over the network.\n- Offline functionality - the client does not need a persistent network connection to operate.\n- Lower backend usage - the load is split between all the clients and the backend.  \n\n**Things you should never run on a device:**  \n- New \"resource\" creation - generating coupons, tickets, etc.\n- Transactions and Payment verification - unless it's delegated to a 3rd-party SDK.\n\n### Offline and Opportunistic State\nAdding an Offline State ensures the app's usability without a network connection:\n- user can like/comment/delete tweets without having a network connection.\n- the UI gets updated \"opportunistically\" assuming that each request will be sent when the network goes back online.\n- the app should display cached results when possible.\n- the app properly notifies users about its Offline State\n- all state changes are batched and sent when the network goes back online.\n#### Request de-duplication\nThe client should ensure that retrying the same request won't create a duplication resource on the server (idempotence). A possible workaround could involve unique client-side generated request identifiers and server-side de-duplication.\n#### Synching Local and Remote States\nA follow-up question might require you to properly handle state synchronization across multiple devices with the same account. Merge conflict resolution could be trickly. Below are a few possible solutions.  \n\n**Local Conflict Resolution**  \nA local device pulls the remote state from the backend after going online, merges it with the local state, and upload changes.  \n\npros:  \n- easy to implement\n\ncons:  \n- insecure - gives a local device authority over the backend.\n- won't solve the problem if multiple devices send their updates simultaneously (the last update \"wins\").\n- any changes in merging logic requires app update.\n\n**Remote Conflict Resolution**  \nA local device sends its local state to the backend after going online, receives a new state, and overwrites the local state.  \n\npros:  \n- moves conflict resolution authority to the backend.\n- does not require client updates.\n\ncons:  \n- more complex backend implementation.\n\n#### More Information\n- Offline functionality for Trello’s mobile applications:\n  - [Airplane Mode: Enabling Trello Mobile Offline](https://tech.trello.com/sync-architecture/)\n  - [Syncing Changes](https://tech.trello.com/syncing-changes/)\n  - [Sync Failure Handling](https://tech.trello.com/sync-failure-handling/)\n  - [The Two ID Problem](https://tech.trello.com/sync-two-id-problem/)\n  - [Offline Attachments](https://tech.trello.com/sync-offline-attachments/)\n  - [Sync is a Two-Way Street](https://tech.trello.com/sync-downloads/)\n  - [Displaying Sync State](https://tech.trello.com/sync-indicators/)\n### Caching\n_TBD_\n### Quality Of Service\nTo make your system more energy-efficient you can introduce the Quality Of Service classes for your network operations. The implementation is quite tricky but you can discuss it on a higher level:\n- Limit the number of concurrent network operations (4-10). The number itself may depend on the device state (battery/wall charger, WiFi/cellular, doze/standby, etc).\n- Assign a Quality Of Service class to each of your network requests:\n  - **User-critical** - should be dispatched as fast as possible: fetching the next page of data for the Tweet Feed; requesting Tweet Details.\n  - **UI-critical** - should be dispatched after User-critical requests: fetching low-res thumb images for tweets on the Feed while scrolling. Canceled if the user scrolls past the target tweet. May be delayed in case of fast scrolling.\n  - **UI-non-critical**: should be dispatched after UI-critical requests: fetching high-res images for tweets on the Feed. Canceled if the user scrolls past the target tweet. May be delayed in case of fast scrolling.\n  - **Background**: should be dispatched after all the above is finished: posting \"likes\", analytics.\n- Introduce a priority queue for scheduling network requests: dispatch requests in the order of their priority. Suspend low-priority requests if the max number of concurrent operations is reached and a high-priority request is scheduled.\n### Resumable Uploads\nA resumable (chunked) media upload breaks down a single upload request in three stages:\n- Upload initialization\n- Chunk bytes uploading (appending)\n- Upload finalization\n\n![Resumable-Uploads](/images/resumable-uploads.svg)\n\n**Advantages of resumable uploads:**\n- Allows you to resume interrupted data transfer operations without restarting from the beginning.  \n\n**Disadvantages of resumable uploads:**\n- An overhead from additional connections and metadata.  \n\n**Note:** Resumable uploads are most effective with large uploads (videos, archives) on unstable networks. For smaller files (images, texts) and stable networks, a single-request upload should be sufficient.  \n\n#### More Info:\n- [YouTube: Resumable Uploads](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol)  \n- [Google Photos: Resumable Uploads](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/resumable-uploads)  \n- [Google Cloud: Resumable Uploads](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/resumable-uploads)  \n- [Twitter: Chunked Media Upload](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/media/upload-media/uploading-media/chunked-media-upload)\n\n### Prefetching\nPrefetching improves app performance by hiding the data transfer latency over slow and unreliable networks. The biggest concern while designing your prefetching solution is the increase in battery and cellular data usage.\n_TBD_\n#### More Info:\n- [Optimize downloads for efficient network access](https://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/efficient-network-access)\n- [Improving performance with background data prefetching](https://instagram-engineering.com/improving-performance-with-background-data-prefetching-b191acb39898)\n- [Informed mobile prefetching](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2307636.2307651)\n- [Understanding prefetching and how Facebook uses prefetching](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1514372351922333)\n## Conclusion\nThere's a significant amount of randomness during a system design interview. The process and the structure can vary depending on the company and the interviewer.\n### Things you can control\n- **Your attitude** - always be friendly no matter how the interview goes. Don't be pushy and don't argue with the interviewer - this might provide a bad \"signal\".\n- **Your preparation** - the better your preparation is, the bigger the chance of a positive outcome. Practice mock design interviews with your peers (you can find people on [Teamblind](https://www.teamblind.com/search/mock)).\n- **Your knowledge** - the more knowledge you have, the better your chances are.\n  - Gain more experience.\n  - Study popular open source projects: [iOS](https://github.com/search?q=iOS&type=Repositories), [Android](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=Android&s=stars&type=Repositories)\n  - Read development blogs from tech companies:\n    - [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/mobile/)\n    - Instagram: [iOS](https://instagram-engineering.com/tagged/ios), [Android](https://instagram-engineering.com/tagged/android)\n    - [Trello](https://tech.trello.com/)\n  \t- Meta\n  \t  - [Engineering at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/tag/mobile/)\n  \t  - [Meta Tech Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/1NlTm7OkZmcrOPfvlqlBMz)    \n    - [Square](https://code.cash.app)\n    - [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/mobile)\n    - [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/topic/technology)\n    - [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/tagged/mobile)\n    - [Lyft Tech Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lyft-mobile/id1453587931)\n    - [Curated List of Blog Posts](/BLOGPOSTS.MD)\n- **Your resume** - make sure to list all your accomplishments with measurable impact.\n### Things you cannot control\n- **Your interviewer's attitude** - they might have a bad day or simply dislike you.\n- **Your competition** - sometimes there's simply a better candidate.\n- **The hiring committee** - they make a decision based on the interviewers' report and your resume.\n### Judging the outcome\nYou _can influence_ the outcome but you _can't control_ it. Don't let minor setbacks determine your self-worth.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How do you know this approach works? Why is this necessary?\n- There's no guarantee that the suggested approach would work well in many cases - the structure of the system design round depends on a personal interviewer style.\n- Having a good interview plan at hand allows both the interviewer and the candidate to concentrate more on the content of the discussion and not organizational aspects of the actual round.\n\n### Can you go a bit deeper at X?\nThis is not necessary since there might be lots of alternative solutions and the guide does not provide the ground truth. The implementation details should depend on the personal experience of the candidate and not on an opinionated approach of some random people from the Internet.\n\n### I'm an interviewer - this ruins the process for all of us: now the candidates just memorize the solutions to cheat during the interview.\n- The system design is much more broad compared to coding rounds. Learning a particular solution is not nearly enough to be successful. The interviewer can slightly tweak the requirements to make it a brand new question. \n- It's really obvious when the candidate memorized a certain approach instead of relying on experience.\n- Learning some patterns and approaches before the interview might help the candidate to ease the stress and deliver the solution in a more clear and structured way.\n\n## Additional Information\nMore System Design exericses [here](/exercises)!\n\n### Junior, Middle, Senior, and Staff level interviews\nThe system design experience would be different depending on the candidate's target level. An approximate engineering level breakdown can be found [here](https://candor.co/articles/tech-careers/google-promotions-the-real-scoop-on-leveling-up).  \n\n_NOTE: There's no clear mapping between years of experience and seniority - some ranges might exist but it largely depends on the candidate's background._\n\n#### Junior engineers\nThe system design round of junior engineers is optional since it's pretty unlikely they would have experience designing software systems.\n\n#### Middle level engineers\nThe middle-level engineering design round might be heavy on the implementation side. The interviewer and the candidate would mostly talk about building a specific component using platform libraries.\n\n#### Senior level engineers\nThe senior-level engineering design round could be more high-level compared to the previous levels. The interviewer and the candidate would mostly talk about multiple components and how they communicate with each other. The implementation details could be less important unless the candidate needs to make a decision that drastically affects the application performance. The candidate should also be able to select a technical stack and describe its advantages and trade-offs.\n\n#### Staff level engineers\nThe staff-level engineering design round moves away from technical to strategic decisions. The candidate might want to discuss the target audience, available computational and human resources, expected traffic, and deadlines. Instead of thinking in terms of implementation tasks - the candidate should put business needs first. For example, being able to explain how to reduce product time-to-market; how to safely rollout and support features; how to handle OMG situations and large-scale outages. The user privacy topics and their legal implications become extremely important and should be discussed in great detail.\n\n## Looking for more content?\n### System Design Exercises\nCheck out the [collection](/exercises) of mobile system design exercises.\n### Common System Design Interview Mistakes\nCheck the guide [here](/common-interview-mistakes.md).\n### Mock Interviews\nCheck out the mock interview [archive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMN-JyH50OYAfxJEpiQTYTD-gxTf7x9d) or [sign-up](https://forms.gle/Cez2R31wqtgp3RsX9) to be a candidate yourself!\n\n## Consider \"starring\" the repository to help other people discover the guide!

It's simple, and exposes the best of both WebSockets (bidirectionality + performance) and Ajax (optional evented ack/reply model).\n\n## Getting started\n\n> Note that there's also a variety of full **[example projects]** available\n\nAdd the necessary dependency to your project:\n\n```clojure\nLeiningen: [com.taoensso/sente \"1.16.2\"] ; or\ndeps.edn:   com.taoensso/sente {:mvn/version \"1.16.2\"}\n```\n\n### On the server (Clojure) side\n\nFirst make sure that you're using one of the [supported web servers][] (PRs for additional server adapters welcome!).\n\nSomewhere in your web app's code you'll already have a routing mechanism in place for handling Ring requests by request URL. If you're using [Compojure] for example, you'll have something that looks like this:\n\n```clojure\n(defroutes my-app\n  (GET  \"/\"            req (my-landing-pg-handler  req))\n  (POST \"/submit-form\" req (my-form-submit-handler req)))\n```\n\nFor Sente, we're going to add 2 new URLs and setup their handlers:\n\n```clojure\n(ns my-server-side-routing-ns ; .clj\n  (:require\n    ;; <other stuff>\n    [taoensso.sente :as sente] ; <--- Add this\n\n    [ring.middleware.anti-forgery :refer [wrap-anti-forgery]] ; <--- Recommended\n\n    ;; Uncomment a web-server adapter --->\n    ;; [taoensso.sente.server-adapters.http-kit      :refer (get-sch-adapter)]\n    ;; [taoensso.sente.server-adapters.immutant      :refer (get-sch-adapter)]\n    ;; [taoensso.sente.server-adapters.nginx-clojure :refer (get-sch-adapter)]\n    ;; [taoensso.sente.server-adapters.aleph         :refer (get-sch-adapter)]\n  ))\n\n;;; Add this: --->\n(let [{:keys [ch-recv send-fn connected-uids\n              ajax-post-fn ajax-get-or-ws-handshake-fn]}\n      (sente/make-channel-socket! (get-sch-adapter) {})]\n\n  (def ring-ajax-post                ajax-post-fn)\n  (def ring-ajax-get-or-ws-handshake ajax-get-or-ws-handshake-fn)\n  (def ch-chsk                       ch-recv) ; ChannelSocket's receive channel\n  (def chsk-send!                    send-fn) ; ChannelSocket's send API fn\n  (def connected-uids                connected-uids) ; Watchable, read-only atom\n  )\n\n(defroutes my-app-routes\n  ;; <other stuff>\n\n  ;;; Add these 2 entries: --->\n  (GET  \"/chsk\" req (ring-ajax-get-or-ws-handshake req))\n  (POST \"/chsk\" req (ring-ajax-post                req))\n  )\n\n(def my-app\n  (-> my-app-routes\n      ;; Add necessary Ring middleware:\n      ring.middleware.keyword-params/wrap-keyword-params\n      ring.middleware.params/wrap-params\n      ring.middleware.anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery\n      ring.middleware.session/wrap-session))\n```\n\n> The `ring-ajax-post` and `ring-ajax-get-or-ws-handshake` fns will automatically handle Ring GET and POST requests to our channel socket URL (`\"/chsk\"`). Together these take care of the messy details of establishing + maintaining WebSocket or long-polling requests.\n\nAdd a CSRF token somewhere in your HTML:\n\n```\n(let [csrf-token (force ring.middleware.anti-forgery/*anti-forgery-token*)]\n  [:div#sente-csrf-token {:data-csrf-token csrf-token}])\n```\n\n### On the client (ClojureScript) side\n\nYou'll setup something similar on the client side:\n\n```clojure\n(ns my-client-side-ns ; .cljs\n  (:require-macros\n   [cljs.core.async.macros :as asyncm :refer (go go-loop)])\n  (:require\n   ;; <other stuff>\n   [cljs.core.async :as async :refer (<! >! put! chan)]\n   [taoensso.sente  :as sente :refer (cb-success?)] ; <--- Add this\n  ))\n\n;;; Add this: --->\n\n(def ?csrf-token\n  (when-let [el (.getElementById js/document \"sente-csrf-token\")]\n    (.getAttribute el \"data-csrf-token\")))\n\n(let [{:keys [chsk ch-recv send-fn state]}\n      (sente/make-channel-socket-client!\n       \"/chsk\" ; Note the same path as before\n       ?csrf-token\n       {:type :auto ; e/o #{:auto :ajax :ws}\n       })]\n\n  (def chsk       chsk)\n  (def ch-chsk    ch-recv) ; ChannelSocket's receive channel\n  (def chsk-send! send-fn) ; ChannelSocket's send API fn\n  (def chsk-state state)   ; Watchable, read-only atom\n  )\n```\n\n### Now what?\n\nThe client will automatically initiate a WebSocket or repeating long-polling connection to your server. Client<->server events are now ready to transmit over the `ch-chsk` channel.\n\n**Last step**: you'll want to **hook your own event handlers up to this channel**. Please see one of the [example projects] for details.\n\n#### Client-side API\n\n * `ch-recv` is a **core.async channel** that'll receive `event-msg`s\n * `chsk-send!` is a `(fn [event & [?timeout-ms ?cb-fn]])` for standard **client>server req>resp calls**\n\n#### Server-side API\n\n * `ch-recv` is a **core.async channel** that'll receive `event-msg`s\n * `chsk-send!` is a `(fn [user-id event])` for async **server>user PUSH calls**\n\n===============\n\nTerm          | Form\n------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nevent         | `[<ev-id> <?ev-data>]`, e.g. `[:my-app/some-req {:data \"data\"}]`\nserver event-msg | `{:keys [event id ?data send-fn ?reply-fn uid ring-req client-id]}`\nclient event-msg | `{:keys [event id ?data send-fn]}`\n`<ev-id>`     | A _namespaced_ keyword like `:my-app/some-req`\n`<?ev-data>`  | An optional _arbitrary edn value_ like `{:data \"data\"}`\n`:ring-req`   | Ring map for Ajax request or WebSocket's initial handshake request\n`:?reply-fn`  | Present only when client requested a reply\n\n#### Summary\n\n * So clients can use `chsk-send!` to send `event`s to the server and optionally request a reply with timeout\n * The server can likewise use `chsk-send!` to send `event`s to _all_ the clients (browser tabs, devices, etc.) of a particular connected user by his/her `user-id`\n * The server can also use an `event-msg`'s `?reply-fn` to _reply_ to a particular client `event` using an _arbitrary edn value_\n\n> It's worth noting that the server>user push `(chsk-send! <user-id> <event>)` takes a mandatory **user-id** argument. See the FAQ later for more info.\n\n### Ajax/Sente comparison: client>server\n\n```clojure\n(jayq/ajax ; Using the jayq wrapper around jQuery\n {:type :post :url \"/some-url-on-server/\"\n  :data {:name \"Rich Hickey\"\n         :type \"Awesome\"}\n  :timeout 8000\n  :success (fn [content text-status xhr]\n             (do-something! content))\n  :error   (fn [xhr text-status] (error-handler!))})\n\n(chsk-send! ; Using Sente\n  [:some/request-id {:name \"Rich Hickey\" :type \"Awesome\"}] ; Event\n  8000 ; Timeout\n  ;; Optional callback:\n  (fn [reply] ; Reply is arbitrary Clojure data\n    (if (sente/cb-success? reply) ; Checks for :chsk/closed, :chsk/timeout, :chsk/error\n      (do-something! reply)\n      (error-handler!))))\n```\n\nSome important differences to note:\n\n * The Ajax request is slow to initialize, and bulky (HTTP overhead)\n * The Sente request is pre-initialized (usu. WebSocket), and lean (edn/Transit protocol)\n\n### Ajax/Sente comparison: server>user push\n\n * Ajax would require clumsy long-polling setup, and wouldn't easily support users connected with multiple clients simultaneously\n * Sente: `(chsk-send! \"destination-user-id\" [:some/alert-id <arb-clj-data-payload>])`\n\n### Channel socket client state\n\nEach time the channel socket client's state changes, a client-side `:chsk/state` event will fire that you can watch for and handle like any other event.\n\nThe event form is `[:chsk/state [<old-state-map> <new-state-map>]]` with the following possible state map keys:\n\nKey             | Value\n--------------- | --------------------------------------------------------\n:type           | e/o `#{:auto :ws :ajax}`\n:open?          | Truthy iff chsk appears to be open (connected) now\n:ever-opened?   | Truthy iff chsk handshake has ever completed successfully\n:first-open?    | Truthy iff chsk just completed first successful handshake\n:uid            | User id provided by server on handshake,    or nil\n:csrf-token     | CSRF token provided by server on handshake, or nil\n:handshake-data | Arb user data provided by server on handshake\n:last-ws-error  | `?{:udt _ :ev <WebSocket-on-error-event>}`\n:last-ws-close  | `?{:udt _ :ev <WebSocket-on-close-event> :clean? _ :code _ :reason _}`\n:last-close     | `?{:udt _ :reason _}`, with reason e/o `#{nil :requested-disconnect :requested-reconnect :downgrading-ws-to-ajax :unexpected}`\n\n### Example projects\n\nLink                                          | Description\n--------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------\n**[Official example]**                        | **Official Sente reference example**, always up-to-date\n[@laforge49/sente-boot]                       | Example using Sente v1.11.0, Boot (also works with Windows)\n[@laforge49/sente-boot-reagent]               | Example using Sente v1.11.0, Boot, and Reagent\n[@tiensonqin/lymchat]                         | Example chat app using React Native\n[@danielsz/system-websockets]                 | Client-side UI, login and wiring of components\n[@timothypratley/snakelake]                   | Multiplayer snake game with screencast walkthrough\n[@theasp/sente-nodejs-example]                | Ref. example adapted for Node.js servers ([Express], [Dog Fort]), as well as a node.js client\n[@ebellani/carpet]                            | Web+mobile interface for a remmitance application\n[@danielsz/sente-system]                      | Ref example adapted for [@danielsz/system]\n[@danielsz/sente-boot]                        | Ref example adapted for [boot]\n[@seancorfield/om-sente]                      | ??\n[@tfoldi/data15-blackjack]                    | Multiplayer blackjack game with documented source code\n[@davidvujic/sente-with-reagent-and-re-frame] | Example code that combines Sente with Reagent and re-frame in a single page application\nYour link here?                               | **PR's welcome!**\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### What is the `user-id` provided to the server>user push fn?\n\n> There's now also a full `user-id`, `client-id` summary up [here](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/issues/118#issuecomment-87378277)\n\nFor the server to push events, we need a destination. Traditionally we might push to a _client_ (e.g. browser tab). But with modern rich web applications and the increasing use of multiple simultaneous devices (tablets, mobiles, etc.) - the value of a _client_ push is diminishing. You'll often see applications (even by Google) struggling to deal with these cases.\n\nSente offers an out-the-box solution by pulling the concept of identity one level higher and dealing with unique _users_ rather than clients. **What constitutes a user is entirely at the discretion of each application**:\n\n * Each user-id may have zero _or more_ connected clients at any given time\n * Each user-id _may_ survive across clients (browser tabs, devices), and sessions\n\n**To give a user an identity, either set the user's `:uid` Ring session key OR supply a `:user-id-fn` (takes request, returns an identity string) to the `make-channel-socket!` constructor.**\n\nIf you want a simple _per-session_ identity, generate a _random uuid_. If you want an identity that persists across sessions, try use something with _semantic meaning_ that you may already have like a database-generated user-id, a login email address, a secure URL fragment, etc.\n\n> Note that user-ids are used **only** for server>user push. client>server requests don't take a user-id.\n\nAs of Sente v0.13.0+ it's also possible to send events to `:sente/all-users-without-uid`.\n\n#### How do I integrate Sente with my usual login/auth procedure?\n\nThis is trivially easy as of Sente v0.13.0+. Please see one of the [example projects][] for details.\n\n#### Will Sente work with Reactjs/Reagent/Om/Pedestel/etc.?\n\nSure! Sente's just a client<->server comms mechanism so it'll work with any view/rendering approach you'd like.\n\nI have a strong preference for [Reagent] myself, so would recommend checking that out first if you're still evaluating options.\n\n#### What if I need to use JSON, XML, raw strings, etc.?\n\nAs of v1, Sente uses an extensible client<->server serialization mechanism. It uses edn by default since this usu. gives good performance and doesn't require any external dependencies. The [reference example project] shows how you can plug in an alternative de/serializer. In particular, note that Sente ships with a Transit de/serializer that allows manual or smart (automatic) per-payload format selection.\n\n#### How do I add custom Transit read and write handlers?\n\nTo add custom handlers to the TransitPacker, pass them in as `writer-opts` and `reader-opts` when creating a `TransitPacker`. These arguments are the same as the `opts` map you would pass directly to `transit/writer`. The code sample below shows how you would do this to add a write handler to convert [Joda-Time] `DateTime` objects to Transit `time` objects.\n\n```clj\n(ns my-ns.app\n  (:require [cognitect.transit :as transit]\n            [taoensso.sente.packers.transit :as sente-transit])\n  (:import [org.joda.time DateTime ReadableInstant]))\n\n;; From https://increasinglyfunctional.com/2014/09/02/custom-transit-writers-clojure-joda-time.html\n(def joda-time-writer\n  (transit/write-handler\n    (constantly \"m\")\n    (fn [v] (-> ^ReadableInstant v .getMillis))\n    (fn [v] (-> ^ReadableInstant v .getMillis .toString))))\n\n(def packer (sente-transit/->TransitPacker :json {:handlers {DateTime joda-time-writer}} {}))\n```\n\n#### How do I route client/server events?\n\nHowever you like! If you don't have many events, a simple `cond` will probably do. Otherwise a multimethod dispatching against event ids works well (this is the approach taken in the [reference example project]).\n\n#### Security: is there HTTPS support?\n\nYup, it's automatic for both Ajax and WebSockets. If the page serving your JavaScript (ClojureScript) is running HTTPS, your Sente channel sockets will run over HTTPS and/or the WebSocket equivalent (WSS).\n\n#### Security: CSRF protection?\n\n**This is important**. Sente has support, and use is **strongly recommended**. You'll need to use middleware like [ring-anti-forgery](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-anti-forgery) or [ring-defaults](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-defaults) to generate and check CSRF codes. The `ring-ajax-post` handler should be covered (i.e. protected).\n\nPlease see one of the [example projects] for a fully-baked example.\n\n#### Pageload: How do I know when Sente is ready client-side?\n\nYou'll want to listen on the receive channel for a `[:chsk/state [_ {:first-open? true}]]` event. That's the signal that the socket's been established.\n\n#### How can server-side channel socket events modify a user's session?\n\n> **Update**: [@danielsz] has kindly provided a detailed example [here](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/issues/62#issuecomment-58790741).\n\nRecall that server-side `event-msg`s are of the form `{:ring-req _ :event _ :?reply-fn _}`, so each server-side event is accompanied by the relevant[*] Ring request.\n\n> For WebSocket events this is the initial Ring HTTP handshake request, for Ajax events it's just the Ring HTTP Ajax request.\n\nThe Ring request's `:session` key is an immutable value, so how do you modify a session in response to an event? You won't be doing this often, but it can be handy (e.g. for login/logout forms).\n\nYou've got two choices:\n\n1. Write any changes directly to your Ring SessionStore (i.e. the mutable state that's actually backing your sessions). You'll need the relevant user's session key, which you can find under your Ring request's `:cookies` key. This is flexible, but requires that you know how+where your session data is being stored.\n\n2. Just use regular HTTP Ajax requests for stuff that needs to modify sessions (like login/logout), since these will automatically go through the usual Ring session middleware and let you modify a session with a simple `{:status 200 :session <new-session>}` response. This is the strategy the reference example takes.\n\n#### Lifecycle management (component management/shutdown, etc.)\n\nUsing something like [@stuartsierra/component] or [@palletops/leaven]?\n\nMost of Sente's state is held internally to each channel socket (the map returned from client/server calls to `make-channel-socket!`). The absence of global state makes things like testing, and running multiple concurrent connections easy. It also makes integration with your component management easy.\n\nThe only thing you _may_[1] want to do on component shutdown is stop any router loops that you've created to dispatch events to handlers. The client/server side `start-chsk-router!` fns both return a `(fn stop [])` that you can call to do this.\n\n> [1] The cost of _not_ doing this is actually negligible (a single parked go thread).\n\nThere's also a couple lifecycle libraries that include Sente components:\n\n 1. [@danielsz/system] for use with [@stuartsierra/component]\n 2. [@palletops/bakery] for use with [@palletops/leaven]\n\n#### How to debug/benchmark Sente at the protocol level?\n\n[@arichiardi] has kindly provided notes on some of Sente's current implementation details [here](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/wiki/Debugging-and-benchmarking-at-the-protocol-level).\n\n#### Any other questions?\n\nIf I've missed something here, feel free to open a GitHub issue or pop me an email!\n\n## Contacting me / contributions\n\nPlease use the project's [GitHub issues page] for all questions, ideas, etc. **Pull requests welcome**.

    "text" : "Introduction\n============\n\nInstaCam, sort of a Instagram alike application for realtime photographing manipulation.\nUnlike Instagram, InstaCam allows user to adjust color filters in realtime with use of\nOpenGL ES 2.0 external OES textures. This allows camera preview to be rendered on\nscreen using regular OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL shaders and in return make it possible to\napply image filters in realtime. While at the same time it's somewhat easy task to\nmaintain same shader code as RenderSctipt implementation for final picture saving.\n\nApplication requires API 15+ so it ain't prime time for it yet but for ones with\nICS update go get it at; http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.harism.instacam .\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nApplication icon used within .APK installation file and on Google Play -market, is taken\nfrom icon pack by [Yanko Andreev](http://yankoa.deviantart.com/). From his MetroDroid\nicon pack to be more precise - which is released under\n[Creative Commons -license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) and\nshould be legal for usage under non-commercial applications.\n\nOther icons used in the application are taken from Faience icon theme made by\n[Matthieu James](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/). These icons are licensed under\nGPLv3 license and it should be sufficient to provide my slightly modified versions\nhere among with other source code..\n\nSome code is translated from [LightBox](https://github.com/lightbox/PhotoProcessing)\nPhoto Processing project into GLSL and RenderScript code. For filters that is. It's\nhighly recommended to take a look on this project if you're into familiarizing\nyourself with color filters.\n\nBeyond these exceptions, all code what-so-ever textual content, including shaders, layouts etc,\nis licensed under Apache 2.0 License (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) and can be used in commercial or personal projects.\n"
